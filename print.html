<p>This guide is meant to help document how rustc – the Rust compiler –
works, as well as to help new contributors get involved in rustc
development. It is not meant to replace code documentation – each
chapter gives only high-level details – the kinds of things that
(ideally) don't change frequently.</p>
<p>There are three parts to this guide. Part 1 contains information that should
be useful no matter how you are contributing. Part 2 contains information
about how the compiler works. Finally, there are some appendices at the
end with useful reference information.</p>
<p>The guide itself is of course open-source as well, and the sources can
be found at the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-guide/">GitHub repository</a>. If you find any mistakes in the
guide, please file an issue about it, or even better, open a PR
with a correction!</p>
<a class="header" href="#part-1-building-debugging-and-contributing-to-rustc" id="part-1-building-debugging-and-contributing-to-rustc"><h1>Part 1: Building, debugging, and contributing to Rustc</h1></a>
<p>This section of the rustc-guide contains knowledge that should be useful to you
regardless of what part of the compiler you are working on. This includes both
technical info and tips (e.g. how to compile and debug the compiler) and info
about processes in the Rust project (e.g. stabilization and info about the
compiler team).</p>
<a class="header" href="#about-the-compiler-team" id="about-the-compiler-team"><h1>About the compiler team</h1></a>
<p>rustc is maintained by the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/language-and-compiler">Rust compiler team</a>. The people who belong to
this team collectively work to track regressions and implement new features.
Members of the Rust compiler team are people who have made significant
contributions to rustc and its design.</p>
<a class="header" href="#discussion" id="discussion"><h2>Discussion</h2></a>
<p>Currently the compiler team chats in a number of places. There is an
ongoing <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/where-should-the-compiler-team-and-perhaps-working-groups-chat/7894">thread</a> on the internals board about trying to find a permanent
home. In any case, you can find people in one of three places at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>#rustc</code> channel on mozilla's IRC (<code>irc.mozilla.org</code>)</li>
<li>The <code>t-compiler</code> stream on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler">the Zulip instance</a></li>
<li>The <code>compiler</code> channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang">rust-lang discord</a></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#expert-map" id="expert-map"><h2>Expert map</h2></a>
<p>If you're interested in figuring out who can answer questions about a
particular part of the compiler, or you'd just like to know who works on what,
check out our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/experts/MAP.md">experts directory</a>.
It contains a listing of the various parts of the compiler and a list of people
who are experts on each one.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rust-compiler-meeting" id="rust-compiler-meeting"><h2>Rust compiler meeting</h2></a>
<p>The compiler team has a weekly meeting where we do triage and try to
generally stay on top of new bugs, regressions, and other things. This
general plan for this meeting can be found in
<a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/rust-compiler-meeting">the rust-compiler-meeting etherpad</a>. It works roughly as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review P-high bugs:</strong> P-high bugs are those that are sufficiently
important for us to actively track progress. P-high bugs should
ideally always have an assignee.</li>
<li><strong>Look over new regressions:</strong> we then look for new cases where the
compiler broke previously working code in the wild. Regressions are
almost always marked as P-high; the major exception would be bug
fixes (though even there we often
<a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/rustc-bug-fix-procedure.html">aim to give warnings first</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Check I-nominated issues:</strong> These are issues where feedback from
the team is desired.</li>
<li><strong>Check for beta nominations:</strong> These are nominations of things to
backport to beta.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting currently takes place on Thursdays at 10am Boston time
(UTC-4 typically, but daylight savings time sometimes makes things
complicated).</p>
<p>The meeting is held over a &quot;chat medium&quot; — it used to be IRC, but we
are currently in the process of evaluating other alternatives. Check
the <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/rust-compiler-meeting">etherpad</a> to find the current home (and see
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/where-should-the-compiler-team-and-perhaps-working-groups-chat/7894">this internals thread</a> for some ongoing discussion).</p>
<a class="header" href="#team-membership" id="team-membership"><h2>Team membership</h2></a>
<p>Membership in the Rust team is typically offered when someone has been
making significant contributions to the compiler for some
time. Membership is both a recognition but also an obligation:
compiler team members are generally expected to help with upkeep as
well as doing reviews and other work.</p>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a compiler team member, the first
thing to do is to start fixing some bugs, or get involved in a working
group. One good way to find bugs is to look for
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy">open issues tagged with E-easy</a>

<a class="header" href="#r-rights" id="r-rights"><h3>r+ rights</h3></a>
<p>Once you have made a number of individual PRs to rustc, we will often
offer r+ privileges. This means that you have the right to instruct
&quot;bors&quot; (the robot that manages which PRs get landed into rustc) to
merge a PR
(<a href="https://buildbot2.rust-lang.org/homu/">here are some instructions for how to talk to bors</a>).</p>
<p>The guidelines for reviewers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are always welcome to review any PR, regardless of who it is
assigned to.  However, do not r+ PRs unless:
<ul>
<li>You are confident in that part of the code.</li>
<li>You are confident that nobody else wants to review it first.
<ul>
<li>For example, sometimes people will express a desire to review a
PR before it lands, perhaps because it touches a particularly
sensitive part of the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always be polite when reviewing: you are a representative of the
Rust project, so it is expected that you will go above and beyond
when it comes to the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#high-five" id="high-five"><h3>high-five</h3></a>
<p>Once you have r+ rights, you can also be added to the high-five
rotation. high-five is the bot that assigns incoming PRs to
reviewers. If you are added, you will be randomly selected to review
PRs. If you find you are assigned a PR that you don't feel comfortable
reviewing, you can also leave a comment like <code>r? @so-and-so</code> to assign
to someone else — if you don't know who to request, just write <code>r? @nikomatsakis for reassignment</code> and @nikomatsakis will pick someone
for you.</p>
<p>Getting on the high-five list is much appreciated as it lowers the
review burden for all of us! However, if you don't have time to give
people timely feedback on their PRs, it may be better that you don't
get on the list.</p>
<a class="header" href="#full-team-membership" id="full-team-membership"><h3>Full team membership</h3></a>
<p>Full team membership is typically extended once someone made many
contributions to the Rust compiler over time, ideally (but not
necessarily) to multiple areas. Sometimes this might be implementing a
new feature, but it is also important — perhaps more important! — to
have time and willingness to help out with general upkeep such as
bugfixes, tracking regressions, and other less glamorous work.</p>

<p>The compiler is built using a tool called <code>x.py</code>. You will need to
have Python installed to run it. But before we get to that, if you're going to
be hacking on <code>rustc</code>, you'll want to tweak the configuration of the compiler.
The default configuration is oriented towards running the compiler as a user,
not a developer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#create-a-configtoml" id="create-a-configtoml"><h3>Create a config.toml</h3></a>
<p>To start, copy <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/config.toml.example"><code>config.toml.example</code></a> to <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cd $RUST_CHECKOUT
&gt; cp config.toml.example config.toml
</code></pre>
<p>Then you will want to open up the file and change the following
settings (and possibly others, such as <code>llvm.ccache</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[llvm]

<a class="header" href="#what-is-xpy" id="what-is-xpy"><h3>What is x.py?</h3></a>
<p>x.py is the script used to orchestrate the tooling in the rustc repository.
It is the script that can build docs, run tests, and compile rustc.
It is the now preferred way to build rustc and it replaces the old makefiles
from before. Below are the different ways to utilize x.py in order to
effectively deal with the repo for various common tasks.</p>
<a class="header" href="#running-xpy-and-building-a-stage1-compiler" id="running-xpy-and-building-a-stage1-compiler"><h3>Running x.py and building a stage1 compiler</h3></a>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that <code>rustc</code> is a <em>bootstrapping</em>
compiler. That is, since <code>rustc</code> is written in Rust, we need to use an
older version of the compiler to compile the newer version. In
particular, the newer version of the compiler, <code>libstd</code>, and other
tooling may use some unstable features internally. The result is that
compiling <code>rustc</code> is done in stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 0:</strong> the stage0 compiler is usually the current <em>beta</em> compiler
(<code>x.py</code> will download it for you); you can configure <code>x.py</code> to use something
else, though.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> the code in your clone (for new version) is then
compiled with the stage0 compiler to produce the stage1 compiler.
However, it was built with an older compiler (stage0), so to
optimize the stage1 compiler we go to next stage.
<ul>
<li>(In theory, the stage1 compiler is functionally identical to the
stage2 compiler, but in practice there are subtle differences. In
particular, the stage1 compiler itself was built by stage0 and
hence not by the source in your working directory: this means that
the symbol names used in the compiler source may not match the
symbol names that would have been made by the stage1 compiler.
This can be important when using dynamic linking (e.g., with
derives. Sometimes this means that some tests don't work when run
with stage1.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> we rebuild our stage1 compiler with itself to produce
the stage2 compiler (i.e. it builds itself) to have all the <em>latest
optimizations</em>. (By default, we copy the stage1 libraries for use by
the stage2 compiler, since they ought to be identical.)</li>
<li><em>(Optional)</em> <strong>Stage 3</strong>: to sanity check of our new compiler, we
can build the libraries with the stage2 compiler. The result ought
to be identical to before, unless something has broken.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#build-flags" id="build-flags"><h4>Build Flags</h4></a>
<p>There are other flags you can pass to the build portion of x.py that can be
beneficial to cutting down compile times or fitting other things you might
need to change. They are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Options:
    -v, --verbose       use verbose output (-vv for very verbose)
    -i, --incremental   use incremental compilation
        --config FILE   TOML configuration file for build
        --build BUILD   build target of the stage0 compiler
        --host HOST     host targets to build
        --target TARGET target targets to build
        --on-fail CMD   command to run on failure
        --stage N       stage to build
        --keep-stage N  stage to keep without recompiling
        --src DIR       path to the root of the rust checkout
    -j, --jobs JOBS     number of jobs to run in parallel
    -h, --help          print this help message
</code></pre>
<p>For hacking, often building the stage 1 compiler is enough, but for
final testing and release, the stage 2 compiler is used.</p>
<p><code>./x.py check</code> is really fast to build the rust compiler.
It is, in particular, very useful when you're doing some kind of
&quot;type-based refactoring&quot;, like renaming a method, or changing the
signature of some function.</p>
<p><a name=command></a></p>
<p>Once you've created a config.toml, you are now ready to run
<code>x.py</code>. There are a lot of options here, but let's start with what is
probably the best &quot;go to&quot; command for building a local rust:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py build -i --stage 1 src/libstd
</code></pre>
<p>This may <em>look</em> like it only builds libstd, but that is not the case.
What this command does is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build libstd using the stage0 compiler (using incremental)</li>
<li>Build librustc using the stage0 compiler (using incremental)
<ul>
<li>This produces the stage1 compiler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build libstd using the stage1 compiler (cannot use incremental)</li>
</ul>
<p>This final product (stage1 compiler + libs built using that compiler)
is what you need to build other rust programs.</p>
<p>Note that the command includes the <code>-i</code> switch. This enables incremental
compilation. This will be used to speed up the first two steps of the process:
in particular, if you make a small change, we ought to be able to use your old
results to make producing the stage1 <strong>compiler</strong> faster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, incremental cannot be used to speed up making the
stage1 libraries.  This is because incremental only works when you run
the <em>same compiler</em> twice in a row.  In this case, we are building a
<em>new stage1 compiler</em> every time. Therefore, the old incremental
results may not apply. <strong>As a result, you will probably find that
building the stage1 libstd is a bottleneck for you</strong> -- but fear not,
there is a (hacky) workaround.  See <a href="#workflow">the section on &quot;recommended
workflows&quot;</a> below.</p>
<p>Note that this whole command just gives you a subset of the full rustc
build. The <strong>full</strong> rustc build (what you get if you just say <code>./x.py build</code>) has quite a few more steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build librustc and rustc with the stage1 compiler.
<ul>
<li>The resulting compiler here is called the &quot;stage2&quot; compiler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build libstd with stage2 compiler.</li>
<li>Build librustdoc and a bunch of other things with the stage2 compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name=toolchain></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#build-specific-components" id="build-specific-components"><h3>Build specific components</h3></a>
<p>Build only the libcore library</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py build src/libcore
</code></pre>
<p>Build the libcore and libproc_macro library only</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py build src/libcore src/libproc_macro
</code></pre>
<p>Build only libcore up to Stage 1</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py build src/libcore --stage 1
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you might just want to test if the part you’re working on can
compile. Using these commands you can test that it compiles before doing
a bigger build to make sure it works with the compiler. As shown before
you can also pass flags at the end such as --stage.</p>
<a class="header" href="#creating-a-rustup-toolchain" id="creating-a-rustup-toolchain"><h3>Creating a rustup toolchain</h3></a>
<p>Once you have successfully built rustc, you will have created a bunch
of files in your <code>build</code> directory. In order to actually run the
resulting rustc, we recommend creating rustup toolchains. The first
one will run the stage1 compiler (which we built above). The second
will execute the stage2 compiler (which we did not build, but which
you will likely need to build at some point; for example, if you want
to run the entire test suite).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustup toolchain link stage1 build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/stage1
&gt; rustup toolchain link stage2 build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/stage2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;host-triple&gt;</code> would typically be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code></li>
<li>Mac: <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>x86_64-pc-windows-msvc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can run the rustc you built with. If you run with <code>-vV</code>, you
should see a version number ending in <code>-dev</code>, indicating a build from
your local environment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc +stage1 -vV
rustc 1.25.0-dev
binary: rustc
commit-hash: unknown
commit-date: unknown
host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
release: 1.25.0-dev
LLVM version: 4.0
</code></pre>
<p><a name=workflow></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#suggested-workflows-for-faster-builds-of-the-compiler" id="suggested-workflows-for-faster-builds-of-the-compiler"><h3>Suggested workflows for faster builds of the compiler</h3></a>
<p>There are two workflows that are useful for faster builds of the
compiler.</p>
<p><strong>Check, check, and check again.</strong> The first workflow, which is useful
when doing simple refactorings, is to run <code>./x.py check</code>
continuously. Here you are just checking that the compiler can
<strong>build</strong>, but often that is all you need (e.g., when renaming a
method). You can then run <code>./x.py build</code> when you actually need to
run tests.</p>
<p>In fact, it is sometimes useful to put off tests even when you are not
100% sure the code will work. You can then keep building up
refactoring commits and only run the tests at some later time. You can
then use <code>git bisect</code> to track down <strong>precisely</strong> which commit caused
the problem. A nice side-effect of this style is that you are left
with a fairly fine-grained set of commits at the end, all of which
build and pass tests. This often helps reviewing.</p>
<p><strong>Incremental builds with <code>--keep-stage</code>.</strong> Sometimes just checking
whether the compiler builds is not enough. A common example is that
you need to add a <code>debug!</code> statement to inspect the value of some
state or better understand the problem. In that case, you really need
a full build.  By leveraging incremental, though, you can often get
these builds to complete very fast (e.g., around 30 seconds): the only
catch is this requires a bit of fudging and may produce compilers that
don't work (but that is easily detected and fixed).</p>
<p>The sequence of commands you want is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial build: <code>./x.py build -i --stage 1 src/libstd</code>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="#command">documented above</a>, this will build a functional
stage1 compiler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsequent builds: <code>./x.py build -i --stage 1 src/libstd --keep-stage 1</code>
<ul>
<li>Note that we added the <code>--keep-stage 1</code> flag here</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of <code>--keep-stage 1</code> is that we just <em>assume</em> that the old
standard library can be re-used. If you are editing the compiler, this
is almost always true: you haven't changed the standard library, after
all.  But sometimes, it's not true: for example, if you are editing
the &quot;metadata&quot; part of the compiler, which controls how the compiler
encodes types and other states into the <code>rlib</code> files, or if you are
editing things that wind up in the metadata (such as the definition of
the MIR).</p>
<p><strong>The TL;DR is that you might get weird behavior from a compile when
using <code>--keep-stage 1</code></strong> -- for example, strange
<a href="appendix/glossary.html">ICEs</a> or other panics. In that case, you
should simply remove the <code>--keep-stage 1</code> from the command and
rebuild.  That ought to fix the problem.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>--keep-stage 1</code> when running tests. Something like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial test run: <code>./x.py test -i --stage 1 src/test/ui</code></li>
<li>Subsequent test run: <code>./x.py test -i --stage 1 src/test/ui --keep-stage 1</code></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#other-xpy-commands" id="other-xpy-commands"><h3>Other x.py commands</h3></a>
<p>Here are a few other useful x.py commands. We'll cover some of them in detail
in other sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building things:
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py clean</code> – clean up the build directory (<code>rm -rf build</code> works too,
but then you have to rebuild LLVM)</li>
<li><code>./x.py build --stage 1</code> – builds everything using the stage 1 compiler,
not just up to libstd</li>
<li><code>./x.py build</code> – builds the stage2 compiler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Running tests (see the <a href="./tests/running.html">section on running tests</a> for
more details):
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py test --stage 1 src/libstd</code> – runs the <code>#[test]</code> tests from libstd</li>
<li><code>./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/run-pass</code> – runs the <code>run-pass</code> test suite</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#ctags" id="ctags"><h3>ctags</h3></a>
<p>One of the challenges with rustc is that the RLS can't handle it, since it's a bootstrapping
compiler. This makes code navigation difficult. One solution is to use <code>ctags</code>. The following
script can be used to set it up: <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-etags">https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-etags</a>.</p>
<p>CTAGS integrates into emacs and vim quite easily. The following can then be
used to build and generate tags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rust-ctags src/lib* &amp;&amp; ./x.py build &lt;something&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to do &quot;jump-to-def&quot; with whatever functions were around when
you last built, which is ridiculously useful.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cleaning-out-build-directories" id="cleaning-out-build-directories"><h3>Cleaning out build directories</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes you need to start fresh, but this is normally not the case.
If you need to run this then rustbuild is most likely not acting right and
you should file a bug as to what is going wrong. If you do need to clean
everything up then you only need to run one command!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py clean
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#compiler-documentation" id="compiler-documentation"><h3>Compiler Documentation</h3></a>
<p>The documentation for the rust components are found at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/">rustc doc</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#build-distribution-artifacts" id="build-distribution-artifacts"><h1>Build distribution artifacts</h1></a>
<p>You might want to build and package up the compiler for distribution.
You’ll want to run this command to do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py dist
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#install-distribution-artifacts" id="install-distribution-artifacts"><h1>Install distribution artifacts</h1></a>
<p>If you’ve built a distribution artifact you might want to install it and
test that it works on your target system. You’ll want to run this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py install
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If you are testing out a modification to a compiler, you
might want to use it to compile some project.
Usually, you do not want to use ./x.py install for testing.
Rather, you should create a toolchain as discussed in
<a href="./how-to-build-and-run.html#creating-a-rustup-toolchain">here</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if the toolchain you created is called foo, you
would then invoke it with <code>rustc +foo ...</code> (where ... represents
the rest of the arguments).</p>
<a class="header" href="#documenting-rustc" id="documenting-rustc"><h1>Documenting rustc</h1></a>
<p>You might want to build documentation of the various components
available like the standard library. There’s two ways to go about this.
You can run rustdoc directly on the file to make sure the HTML is
correct, which is fast. Alternatively, you can build the documentation
as part of the  build process through x.py. Both are viable methods
since documentation  is more about the content.</p>

<p>Much like individual tests or building certain components you can build only
the documentation you want.</p>
<a class="header" href="#document-internal-rustc-items" id="document-internal-rustc-items"><h2>Document internal rustc items</h2></a>
<p>Compiler documentation is not built by default. There's a flag in

<p>Next open up config.toml and make sure these two lines are set to true:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docs = true
compiler-docs = true
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to build the compiler docs as well run this command:</p>

<a class="header" href="#the-compiler-testing-framework" id="the-compiler-testing-framework"><h1>The compiler testing framework</h1></a>
<p>The Rust project runs a wide variety of different tests, orchestrated
by the build system (<code>x.py test</code>).  The main test harness for testing
the compiler itself is a tool called compiletest (sources in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest"><code>src/tools/compiletest</code></a>). This section gives a brief overview of how
the testing framework is setup, and then gets into some of the details
on <a href="./running.html#ui">how to run tests</a> as well as
<a href="./adding.html">how to add new tests</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#compiletest-test-suites" id="compiletest-test-suites"><h2>Compiletest test suites</h2></a>
<p>The compiletest tests are located in the tree in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test"><code>src/test</code></a>
directory. Immediately within you will see a series of subdirectories
(e.g. <code>ui</code>, <code>run-make</code>, and so forth). Each of those directories is
called a <strong>test suite</strong> – they house a group of tests that are run in
a distinct mode.</p>
<p>Here is a brief summary of the test suites as of this writing and what
they mean. In some cases, the test suites are linked to parts of the manual
that give more details.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./adding.html#ui"><code>ui</code></a> – tests that check the exact
stdout/stderr from compilation and/or running the test</li>
<li><code>run-pass</code> – tests that are expected to compile and execute
successfully (no panics)
<ul>
<li><code>run-pass-valgrind</code> – tests that ought to run with valgrind</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>run-fail</code> – tests that are expected to compile but then panic
during execution</li>
<li><code>compile-fail</code> – tests that are expected to fail compilation.</li>
<li><code>parse-fail</code> – tests that are expected to fail to parse</li>
<li><code>pretty</code> – tests targeting the Rust &quot;pretty printer&quot;, which
generates valid Rust code from the AST</li>
<li><code>debuginfo</code> – tests that run in gdb or lldb and query the debug info</li>
<li><code>codegen</code> – tests that compile and then test the generated LLVM
code to make sure that the optimizations we want are taking effect.</li>
<li><code>assembly</code> – similar to <code>codegen</code> tests, but verifies assembly output
to make sure LLVM target backend can handle provided code.</li>
<li><code>mir-opt</code> – tests that check parts of the generated MIR to make
sure we are building things correctly or doing the optimizations we
expect.</li>
<li><code>incremental</code> – tests for incremental compilation, checking that
when certain modifications are performed, we are able to reuse the
results from previous compilations.</li>
<li><code>run-make</code> – tests that basically just execute a <code>Makefile</code>; the
ultimate in flexibility but quite annoying to write.</li>
<li><code>rustdoc</code> – tests for rustdoc, making sure that the generated files
contain the expected documentation.</li>
<li><code>*-fulldeps</code> – same as above, but indicates that the test depends
on things other than <code>libstd</code> (and hence those things must be built)</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#other-tests" id="other-tests"><h2>Other Tests</h2></a>
<p>The Rust build system handles running tests for various other things,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tidy</strong> – This is a custom tool used for validating source code
style and formatting conventions, such as rejecting long lines.
There is more information in the
<a href="../conventions.html#formatting">section on coding conventions</a>.</p>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/tools/tidy</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unit tests</strong> – The Rust standard library and many of the Rust packages
include typical Rust <code>#[test]</code> unittests.  Under the hood, <code>x.py</code> will run
<code>cargo test</code> on each package to run all the tests.</p>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/libstd</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Doc tests</strong> – Example code embedded within Rust documentation is executed
via <code>rustdoc --test</code>.  Examples:</p>
<p><code>./x.py test src/doc</code> – Runs <code>rustdoc --test</code> for all documentation in
<code>src/doc</code>.</p>
<p><code>./x.py test --doc src/libstd</code> – Runs <code>rustdoc --test</code> on the standard
library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link checker</strong> – A small tool for verifying <code>href</code> links within
documentation.</p>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/tools/linkchecker</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dist check</strong> – This verifies that the source distribution tarball created

<p>Example: <code>./x.py test distcheck</code></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Tool tests</strong> – Packages that are included with Rust have all of their
tests run as well (typically by running <code>cargo test</code> within their
directory).  This includes things such as cargo, clippy, rustfmt, rls, miri,
bootstrap (testing the Rust build system itself), etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cargo test</strong> – This is a small tool which runs <code>cargo test</code> on a few
significant projects (such as <code>servo</code>, <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>tokei</code>, etc.) just to
ensure there aren't any significant regressions.</p>

<a class="header" href="#crater" id="crater"><h2>Crater</h2></a>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/crater">Crater</a> is a tool for compiling
and running tests for <em>every</em> crate on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> (and a
few on GitHub). It is mainly used for checking for extent of breakage when
implementing potentially breaking changes and ensuring lack of breakage by
running beta vs stable compiler versions.</p>
<a class="header" href="#when-to-run-crater" id="when-to-run-crater"><h3>When to run Crater</h3></a>
<p>You should request a crater run if your PR makes large changes to the compiler
or could cause breakage. If you are unsure, feel free to ask your PR's reviewer.</p>
<a class="header" href="#requesting-crater-runs" id="requesting-crater-runs"><h3>Requesting Crater Runs</h3></a>
<p>The rust team maintains a few machines that can be used for running crater runs
on the changes introduced by a PR. If your PR needs a crater run, leave a
comment for the triage team in the PR thread. Please inform the team whether
you require a &quot;check-only&quot; crater run, a &quot;build only&quot; crater run, or a
&quot;build-and-test&quot; crater run. The difference is primarily in time; the
conservative (if you're not sure) option is to go for the build-and-test run.
If making changes that will only have an effect at compile-time (e.g.,
implementing a new trait) then you only need a check run.</p>
<p>Your PR will be enqueued by the triage team and the results will be posted when
they are ready. Check runs will take around ~3-4 days, with the other two
taking 5-6 days on average.</p>
<p>While crater is really useful, it is also important to be aware of a few
caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not all code is on crates.io! There is a lot of code in repos on GitHub and
elsewhere. Also, companies may not wish to publish their code. Thus, a
successful crater run is not a magically green light that there will be no
breakage; you still need to be careful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crater only runs Linux builds on x86_64. Thus, other architectures and
platforms are not tested. Critically, this includes Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many crates are not tested. This could be for a lot of reasons, including
that the crate doesn't compile any more (e.g. used old nightly features),
has broken or flaky tests, requires network access, or other reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before crater can be run, <code>@bors try</code> needs to succeed in building artifacts.
This means that if your code doesn't compile, you cannot run crater.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#perf-runs" id="perf-runs"><h2>Perf runs</h2></a>
<p>A lot of work is put into improving the performance of the compiler and
preventing performance regressions. A &quot;perf run&quot; is used to compare the
performance of the compiler in different configurations for a large collection
of popular crates. Different configurations include &quot;fresh builds&quot;, builds
with incremental compilation, etc.</p>
<p>The result of a perf run is a comparison between two versions of the
compiler (by their commit hashes).</p>
<p>You should request a perf run if your PR may affect performance, especially
if it can affect performance adversely.</p>

<p>The following blog posts may also be of interest:</p>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#running-tests" id="running-tests"><h1>Running tests</h1></a>
<p>You can run the tests using <code>x.py</code>. The most basic command – which
you will almost never want to use! – is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py test
</code></pre>
<p>This will build the full stage 2 compiler and then run the whole test
suite. You probably don't want to do this very often, because it takes
a very long time, and anyway bors / travis will do it for you. (Often,
I will run this command in the background after opening a PR that I
think is done, but rarely otherwise. -nmatsakis)</p>
<p>The test results are cached and previously successful tests are
<code>ignored</code> during testing. The stdout/stderr contents as well as a
timestamp file for every test can be found under <code>build/ARCH/test/</code>.
To force-rerun a test (e.g. in case the test runner fails to notice
a change) you can simply remove the timestamp file.</p>
<p>Note that some tests require a Python-enabled gdb. You can test if
your gdb install supports Python by using the <code>python</code> command from
within gdb. Once invoked you can type some Python code (e.g.
<code>print(&quot;hi&quot;)</code>) followed by return and then <code>CTRL+D</code> to execute it.
If you are building gdb from source, you will need to configure with
<code>--with-python=&lt;path-to-python-binary&gt;</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#running-a-subset-of-the-test-suites" id="running-a-subset-of-the-test-suites"><h2>Running a subset of the test suites</h2></a>
<p>When working on a specific PR, you will usually want to run a smaller
set of tests, and with a stage 1 build. For example, a good &quot;smoke
test&quot; that can be used after modifying rustc to see if things are
generally working correctly would be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/{ui,compile-fail,run-pass}
</code></pre>
<p>This will run the <code>ui</code>, <code>compile-fail</code>, and <code>run-pass</code> test suites,
and only with the stage 1 build. Of course, the choice of test suites
is somewhat arbitrary, and may not suit the task you are doing. For
example, if you are hacking on debuginfo, you may be better off with
the debuginfo test suite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/debuginfo
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#run-only-the-tidy-script" id="run-only-the-tidy-script"><h3>Run only the tidy script</h3></a>

</code></pre>
<p>By listing which test suites you want to run you avoid having to run
tests for components you did not change at all.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Note that bors only runs the tests with the full stage 2
build; therefore, while the tests <strong>usually</strong> work fine with stage 1,
there are some limitations. In particular, the stage1 compiler doesn't
work well with procedural macros or custom derive tests.</p>
<a class="header" href="#running-an-individual-test" id="running-an-individual-test"><h2>Running an individual test</h2></a>
<p>Another common thing that people want to do is to run an <strong>individual
test</strong>, often the test they are trying to fix. One way to do this is
to invoke <code>x.py</code> with the <code>--test-args</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui --test-args issue-1234
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood, the test runner invokes the standard rust test runner
(the same one you get with <code>#[test]</code>), so this command would wind up
filtering for tests that include &quot;issue-1234&quot; in the name.</p>
<a class="header" href="#using-incremental-compilation" id="using-incremental-compilation"><h2>Using incremental compilation</h2></a>
<p>You can further enable the <code>--incremental</code> flag to save additional
time in subsequent rebuilds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui --incremental --test-args issue-1234
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want to include the flag with every command, you can
enable it in the <code>config.toml</code>, too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># Whether to always use incremental compilation when building rustc
incremental = true
</code></pre>
<p>Note that incremental compilation will use more disk space than usual.
If disk space is a concern for you, you might want to check the size
of the <code>build</code> directory from time to time.</p>
<a class="header" href="#running-tests-manually" id="running-tests-manually"><h2>Running tests manually</h2></a>
<p>Sometimes it's easier and faster to just run the test by hand. Most tests are
just <code>rs</code> files, so you can do something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc +stage1 src/test/ui/issue-1234.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This is much faster, but doesn't always work. For example, some tests
include directives that specify specific compiler flags, or which rely
on other crates, and they may not run the same without those options.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-new-tests" id="adding-new-tests"><h1>Adding new tests</h1></a>
<p><strong>In general, we expect every PR that fixes a bug in rustc to come
accompanied by a regression test of some kind.</strong> This test should fail
in master but pass after the PR. These tests are really useful for
preventing us from repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>To add a new test, the first thing you generally do is to create a
file, typically a Rust source file. Test files have a particular
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>They should have some kind of
<a href="#explanatory_comment">comment explaining what the test is about</a>;</li>
<li>next, they can have one or more <a href="#header_commands">header commands</a>, which
are special comments that the test interpreter knows how to interpret.</li>
<li>finally, they have the Rust source. This may have various <a href="#error_annotations">error
annotations</a> which indicate expected compilation errors or
warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the test suite, there may be some other details to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>For <a href="#ui">the <code>ui</code> test suite</a>, you need to generate reference output files.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#what-kind-of-test-should-i-add" id="what-kind-of-test-should-i-add"><h2>What kind of test should I add?</h2></a>
<p>It can be difficult to know what kind of test to use. Here are some
rough heuristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some tests have specialized needs:
<ul>
<li>need to run gdb or lldb? use the <code>debuginfo</code> test suite</li>
<li>need to inspect LLVM IR or MIR IR? use the <code>codegen</code> or <code>mir-opt</code> test
suites</li>
<li>need to run rustdoc? Prefer a <code>rustdoc</code> test</li>
<li>need to inspect the resulting binary in some way? Then use <code>run-make</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For most other things, <a href="#ui">a <code>ui</code> (or <code>ui-fulldeps</code>) test</a> is to be
preferred:
<ul>
<li><code>ui</code> tests subsume both run-pass, compile-fail, and parse-fail tests</li>
<li>in the case of warnings or errors, <code>ui</code> tests capture the full output,
which makes it easier to review but also helps prevent &quot;hidden&quot; regressions
in the output</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#naming-your-test" id="naming-your-test"><h2>Naming your test</h2></a>
<p>We have not traditionally had a lot of structure in the names of
tests.  Moreover, for a long time, the rustc test runner did not
support subdirectories (it now does), so test suites like
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/run-pass/"><code>src/test/run-pass</code></a> have a huge mess of files in them. This is not
considered an ideal setup.</p>
<p>For regression tests – basically, some random snippet of code that
came in from the internet – we often just name the test after the
issue. For example, <code>src/test/run-pass/issue-12345.rs</code>. If possible,
though, it is better if you can put the test into a directory that
helps identify what piece of code is being tested here (e.g.,
<code>borrowck/issue-12345.rs</code> is much better), or perhaps give it a more
meaningful name. Still, <strong>do include the issue number somewhere</strong>.</p>
<p>When writing a new feature, <strong>create a subdirectory to store your
tests</strong>. For example, if you are implementing RFC 1234 (&quot;Widgets&quot;),
then it might make sense to put the tests in directories like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/test/ui/rfc1234-widgets/</code></li>
<li><code>src/test/run-pass/rfc1234-widgets/</code></li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>In other cases, there may already be a suitable directory. (The proper
directory structure to use is actually an area of active debate.)</p>
<p><a name="explanatory_comment"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#comment-explaining-what-the-test-is-about" id="comment-explaining-what-the-test-is-about"><h2>Comment explaining what the test is about</h2></a>
<p>When you create a test file, <strong>include a comment summarizing the point
of the test at the start of the file</strong>. This should highlight which
parts of the test are more important, and what the bug was that the
test is fixing. Citing an issue number is often very helpful.</p>
<p>This comment doesn't have to be super extensive. Just something like
&quot;Regression test for #18060: match arms were matching in the wrong
order.&quot;  might already be enough.</p>
<p>These comments are very useful to others later on when your test
breaks, since they often can highlight what the problem is. They are
also useful if for some reason the tests need to be refactored, since
they let others know which parts of the test were important (often a
test must be rewritten because it no longer tests what is was meant to
test, and then it's useful to know what it <em>was</em> meant to test
exactly).</p>
<p><a name="header_commands"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#header-commands-configuring-rustc" id="header-commands-configuring-rustc"><h2>Header commands: configuring rustc</h2></a>
<p>Header commands are special comments that the test runner knows how to
interpret.  They must appear before the Rust source in the test. They
are normally put after the short comment that explains the point of
this test. For example, this test uses the <code>// compile-flags</code> command
to specify a custom flag to give to rustc when the test is compiled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Test the behavior of `0 - 1` when overflow checks are disabled.

// compile-flags: -Coverflow-checks=off

fn main() {
    let x = 0 - 1;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#ignoring-tests" id="ignoring-tests"><h3>Ignoring tests</h3></a>
<p>These are used to ignore the test in some situations, which means the test won't
be compiled or run.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ignore-X</code> where <code>X</code> is a target detail or stage will ignore the
test accordingly (see below)</li>
<li><code>only-X</code> is like <code>ignore-X</code>, but will <em>only</em> run the test on that

<li><code>ignore-pretty</code> will not compile the pretty-printed test (this is

<li><code>ignore-test</code> always ignores the test</li>
<li><code>ignore-lldb</code> and <code>ignore-gdb</code> will skip a debuginfo test on that
debugger.</li>
<li><code>ignore-gdb-version</code> can be used to ignore the test when certain gdb
versions are used</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of <code>X</code> in <code>ignore-X</code>:</p>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#other-header-commands" id="other-header-commands"><h3>Other Header Commands</h3></a>
<p>Here is a list of other header commands. This list is not
exhaustive. Header commands can generally be found by browsing the
<code>TestProps</code> structure found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs"><code>header.rs</code></a> from the compiletest
source.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>run-rustfix</code> for UI tests, indicates that the test produces
structured suggestions. The test writer should create a <code>.fixed</code>
file, which contains the source with the suggestions applied.
When the test is run, compiletest first checks that the correct
lint/warning is generated. Then, it applies the suggestion and
compares against <code>.fixed</code> (they must match). Finally, the fixed
source is compiled, and this compilation is required to succeed.
The <code>.fixed</code> file can also be generated automatically with the
<code>--bless</code> option, discussed <a href="#bless">below</a>.</li>
<li><code>min-gdb-version</code> specifies the minimum gdb version required for
this test; see also <code>ignore-gdb-version</code></li>
<li><code>min-lldb-version</code> specifies the minimum lldb version required for
this test</li>
<li><code>rust-lldb</code> causes the lldb part of the test to only be run if the
lldb in use contains the Rust plugin</li>
<li><code>no-system-llvm</code> causes the test to be ignored if the system llvm is used</li>
<li><code>min-llvm-version</code> specifies the minimum llvm version required for
this test</li>
<li><code>min-system-llvm-version</code> specifies the minimum system llvm version
required for this test; the test is ignored if the system llvm is in
use and it doesn't meet the minimum version.  This is useful when an
llvm feature has been backported to rust-llvm</li>
<li><code>ignore-llvm-version</code> can be used to skip the test when certain LLVM
versions are used.  This takes one or two arguments; the first
argument is the first version to ignore.  If no second argument is
given, all subsequent versions are ignored; otherwise, the second
argument is the last version to ignore.</li>
<li><code>compile-pass</code> for UI tests, indicates that the test is
supposed to compile, as opposed to the default where the test is
supposed to error out.</li>
<li><code>compile-flags</code> passes extra command-line args to the compiler,
e.g. <code>compile-flags -g</code> which forces debuginfo to be enabled.</li>
<li><code>should-fail</code> indicates that the test should fail; used for &quot;meta
testing&quot;, where we test the compiletest program itself to check that
it will generate errors in appropriate scenarios. This header is
ignored for pretty-printer tests.</li>
<li><code>gate-test-X</code> where <code>X</code> is a feature marks the test as &quot;gate test&quot;
for feature X.  Such tests are supposed to ensure that the compiler
errors when usage of a gated feature is attempted without the proper
<code>#![feature(X)]</code> tag.  Each unstable lang feature is required to
have a gate test.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="error_annotations"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#error-annotations" id="error-annotations"><h2>Error annotations</h2></a>
<p>Error annotations specify the errors that the compiler is expected to
emit. They are &quot;attached&quot; to the line in source where the error is
located.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the
current line</li>
<li><code>~|</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the same
line as the previous comment</li>
<li><code>~^</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the
previous line. Each caret (<code>^</code>) that you add adds a line to this, so
<code>~^^^^^^^</code> is seven lines up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The error levels that you can have are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ERROR</code></li>
<li><code>WARNING</code></li>
<li><code>NOTE</code></li>
<li><code>HELP</code> and <code>SUGGESTION</code>*</li>
</ol>
<p>* <strong>Note</strong>: <code>SUGGESTION</code> must follow immediately after <code>HELP</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#revisions" id="revisions"><h2>Revisions</h2></a>
<p>Certain classes of tests support &quot;revisions&quot; (as of the time of this
writing, this includes run-pass, compile-fail, run-fail, and
incremental, though incremental tests are somewhat
different). Revisions allow a single test file to be used for multiple
tests. This is done by adding a special header at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// revisions: foo bar baz
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This will result in the test being compiled (and tested) three times,
once with <code>--cfg foo</code>, once with <code>--cfg bar</code>, and once with <code>--cfg baz</code>. You can therefore use <code>#[cfg(foo)]</code> etc within the test to tweak
each of these results.</p>
<p>You can also customize headers and expected error messages to a particular
revision. To do this, add <code>[foo]</code> (or <code>bar</code>, <code>baz</code>, etc) after the <code>//</code>
comment, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// A flag to pass in only for cfg `foo`:
//[foo]compile-flags: -Z verbose

#[cfg(foo)]
fn test_foo() {
    let x: usize = 32_u32; //[foo]~ ERROR mismatched types
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that not all headers have meaning when customized to a revision.
For example, the <code>ignore-test</code> header (and all &quot;ignore&quot; headers)
currently only apply to the test as a whole, not to particular
revisions. The only headers that are intended to really work when
customized to a revision are error patterns and compiler flags.</p>

capturing the output, and then applying some normalization (see
below). This normalized result is then compared against reference
files named <code>ui/hello_world/main.stderr</code> and
<code>ui/hello_world/main.stdout</code>. If either of those files doesn't exist,
the output must be empty (that is actually the case for
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/hello_world/">this particular test</a>). If the test run fails, we will print out
the current output, but it is also saved in
<code>build/&lt;target-triple&gt;/test/ui/hello_world/main.stdout</code> (this path is
printed as part of the test failure message), so you can run <code>diff</code>
and so forth.</p>
<a class="header" href="#tests-that-do-not-result-in-compile-errors" id="tests-that-do-not-result-in-compile-errors"><h3>Tests that do not result in compile errors</h3></a>
<p>By default, a UI test is expected <strong>not to compile</strong> (in which case,
it should contain at least one <code>//~ ERROR</code> annotation). However, you
can also make UI tests where compilation is expected to succeed, and
you can even run the resulting program. Just add one of the following
<a href="#header_commands">header commands</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>// compile-pass</code> – compilation should succeed but do
not run the resulting binary</li>
<li><code>// run-pass</code> – compilation should succeed and we should run the
resulting binary</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="bless"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#editing-and-updating-the-reference-files" id="editing-and-updating-the-reference-files"><h3>Editing and updating the reference files</h3></a>
<p>If you have changed the compiler's output intentionally, or you are
making a new test, you can pass <code>--bless</code> to the test subcommand. E.g.
if some tests in <code>src/test/ui</code> are failing, you can run</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui --bless
</code></pre>
<p>to automatically adjust the <code>.stderr</code>, <code>.stdout</code> or <code>.fixed</code> files of
all tests. Of course you can also target just specific tests with the
<code>--test-args your_test_name</code> flag, just like when running the tests.</p>
<a class="header" href="#normalization" id="normalization"><h3>Normalization</h3></a>
<p>The normalization applied is aimed at eliminating output difference
between platforms, mainly about filenames:</p>
<ul>
<li>the test directory is replaced with <code>$DIR</code></li>
<li>all backslashes (<code>\</code>) are converted to forward slashes (<code>/</code>) (for Windows)</li>
<li>all CR LF newlines are converted to LF</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes these built-in normalizations are not enough. In such cases, you
may provide custom normalization rules using the header commands, e.g.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
// normalize-stdout-test: &quot;foo&quot; -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;
// normalize-stderr-32bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(32 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;
// normalize-stderr-64bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(64 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This tells the test, on 32-bit platforms, whenever the compiler writes
<code>fn() (32 bits)</code> to stderr, it should be normalized to read <code>fn() ($PTR bits)</code>
instead. Similar for 64-bit. The replacement is performed by regexes using
default regex flavor provided by <code>regex</code> crate.</p>
<p>The corresponding reference file will use the normalized output to test both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">...
   |
   = note: source type: fn() ($PTR bits)
   = note: target type: u16 (16 bits)
...
</code></pre>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/transmute/main.rs"><code>ui/transmute/main.rs</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/transmute/main.stderr"><code>main.stderr</code></a> for a
concrete usage example.</p>
<p>Besides <code>normalize-stderr-32bit</code> and <code>-64bit</code>, one may use any target
information or stage supported by <code>ignore-X</code> here as well (e.g.
<code>normalize-stderr-windows</code> or simply <code>normalize-stderr-test</code> for unconditional
replacement).</p>
<a class="header" href="#compiletest" id="compiletest"><h1><code>compiletest</code></h1></a>
<a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p><code>compiletest</code> is the main test harness of the Rust test suite.  It allows
test authors to organize large numbers of tests (the Rust compiler has many
thousands), efficient test execution (parallel execution is supported), and
allows the test author to configure behavior and expected results of both
individual and groups of tests.</p>
<p><code>compiletest</code> tests may check test code for success, for failure or in some
cases, even failure to compile.  Tests are typically organized as a Rust source
file with annotations in comments before and/or within the test code, which
serve to direct <code>compiletest</code> on if or how to run the test, what behavior to
expect, and more.  If you are unfamiliar with the compiler testing framework,
see <a href="./tests/intro.html">this chapter</a> for additional background.</p>
<p>The tests themselves are typically (but not always) organized into
&quot;suites&quot; – for example, <code>run-pass</code>, a folder representing tests that should
succeed, <code>run-fail</code>, a folder holding tests that should compile successfully,
but return a failure (non-zero status), <code>compile-fail</code>, a folder holding tests
that should fail to compile, and many more.  The various suites are defined in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs">src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs</a> in the <code>pub struct Config</code>
declaration.  And a very good introduction to the different suites of compiler
tests along with details about them can be found in <a href="./tests/adding.html">Adding new
tests</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-test-file" id="adding-a-new-test-file"><h2>Adding a new test file</h2></a>
<p>Briefly, simply create your new test in the appropriate location under
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test">src/test</a>. No registration of test files is necessary as <code>compiletest</code>
will scan the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test">src/test</a> subfolder recursively, and will execute any Rust
source files it finds as tests.  See <a href="./tests/adding.html"><code>Adding new tests</code></a>
for a complete guide on how to adding new tests.</p>
<a class="header" href="#header-commands" id="header-commands"><h2>Header Commands</h2></a>
<p>Source file annotations which appear in comments near the top of the source
file <em>before</em> any test code are known as header commands.  These commands can
instruct <code>compiletest</code> to ignore this test, set expectations on whether it is
expected to succeed at compiling, or what the test's return code is expected to
be.  Header commands (and their inline counterparts, Error Info commands) are
described more fully
<a href="./tests/adding.html#header-commands-configuring-rustc">here</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-header-command" id="adding-a-new-header-command"><h3>Adding a new header command</h3></a>
<p>Header commands are defined in the <code>TestProps</code> struct in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs">src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</a>.  At a high level, there are
dozens of test properties defined here, all set to default values in the
<code>TestProp</code> struct's <code>impl</code> block. Any test can override this default value by
specifying the property in question as header command as a comment (<code>//</code>) in
the test source file, before any source code.</p>
<a class="header" href="#using-a-header-command" id="using-a-header-command"><h4>Using a header command</h4></a>
<p>Here is an example, specifying the <code>must-compile-successfully</code> header command,
which takes no arguments, followed by the <code>failure-status</code> header command,
which takes a single argument (which, in this case is a value of 1).
<code>failure-status</code> is instructing <code>compiletest</code> to expect a failure status of 1
(rather than the current Rust default of 101 at the time of this writing).  The
header command and the argument list (if present) are typically separated by a
colon:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// must-compile-successfully
// failure-status: 1

#![feature(termination_trait)]

use std::io::{Error, ErrorKind};

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;Error&gt;&gt; {
    Err(Box::new(Error::new(ErrorKind::Other, &quot;returned Box&lt;Error&gt; from main()&quot;)))
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-header-command-property" id="adding-a-new-header-command-property"><h4>Adding a new header command property</h4></a>
<p>One would add a new header command if there is a need to define some test
property or behavior on an individual, test-by-test basis.  A header command
property serves as the header command's backing store (holds the command's
current value) at runtime.</p>
<p>To add a new header command property:
1. Look for the <code>pub struct TestProps</code> declaration in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs">src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</a> and add the new public
property to the end of the declaration.
2. Look for the <code>impl TestProps</code> implementation block immediately following
the struct declaration and initialize the new property to its default
value.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-header-command-parser" id="adding-a-new-header-command-parser"><h4>Adding a new header command parser</h4></a>
<p>When <code>compiletest</code> encounters a test file, it parses the file a line at a time
by calling every parser defined in the <code>Config</code> struct's implementation block,
also in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs">src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</a> (note the <code>Config</code>
struct's declaration block is found in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs">src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs</a>.  <code>TestProps</code>'s <code>load_from()</code>
method will try passing the current line of text to each parser, which, in turn
typically checks to see if the line begins with a particular commented (<code>//</code>)
header command such as <code>// must-compile-successfully</code> or <code>// failure-status</code>.
Whitespace after the comment marker is optional.</p>
<p>Parsers will override a given header command property's default value merely by
being specified in the test file as a header command or by having a parameter
value specified in the test file, depending on the header command.</p>
<p>Parsers defined in <code>impl Config</code> are typically named <code>parse_&lt;header_command&gt;</code>
(note kebab-case <code>&lt;header-command&gt;</code> transformed to snake-case
<code>&lt;header_command&gt;</code>).  <code>impl Config</code> also defines several 'low-level' parsers
which make it simple to parse common patterns like simple presence or not
(<code>parse_name_directive()</code>), header-command:parameter(s)
(<code>parse_name_value_directive()</code>), optional parsing only if a particular <code>cfg</code>
attribute is defined (<code>has_cfg_prefix()</code>) and many more.  The low-level parsers
are found near the end of the <code>impl Config</code> block; be sure to look through them
and their associated parsers immediately above to see how they are used to
avoid writing additional parsing code unnecessarily.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, here is the implementation for the
<code>parse_failure_status()</code> parser, in

<a class="header" href="#implementing-the-behavior-change" id="implementing-the-behavior-change"><h2>Implementing the behavior change</h2></a>
<p>When a test invokes a particular header command, it is expected that some
behavior will change as a result.  What behavior, obviously, will depend on the
purpose of the header command.  In the case of <code>failure-status</code>, the behavior
that changes is that <code>compiletest</code> expects the failure code defined by the
header command invoked in the test, rather than the default value.</p>

different implementation in order to invoke behavior change) perhaps it is

example.  To implement <code>failure-status</code>, the <code>check_correct_failure_status()</code>

property.  In tests which do not specify the failure status header command,
<code>self.props.failure_status</code> will evaluate to the default value of 101 at the

example, <code>// failure-status: 1</code>, <code>self.props.failure_status</code> will evaluate to
1, as <code>parse_failure_status()</code> will have overridden the <code>TestProps</code> default

<a class="header" href="#walkthrough-a-typical-contribution" id="walkthrough-a-typical-contribution"><h1>Walkthrough: a typical contribution</h1></a>
<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of ways to contribute to the rust compiler, including fixing
bugs, improving performance, helping design features, providing feedback on
existing features, etc. This chapter does not claim to scratch the surface.
Instead, it walks through the design and implementation of a new feature. Not
all of the steps and processes described here are needed for every
contribution, and I will try to point those out as they arise.</p>
<p>In general, if you are interested in making a contribution and aren't sure
where to start, please feel free to ask!</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview" id="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>The feature I will discuss in this chapter is the <code>?</code> Kleene operator for
macros. Basically, we want to be able to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro_rules! foo {
    ($arg:ident $(, $optional_arg:ident)?) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $arg);

        $(
            println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $optional_arg);
        )?
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 0;
    foo!(x); // ok! prints &quot;0&quot;
    foo!(x, x); // ok! prints &quot;0 0&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So basically, the <code>$(pat)?</code> matcher in the macro means &quot;this pattern can occur
0 or 1 times&quot;, similar to other regex syntaxes.</p>
<p>There were a number of steps to go from an idea to stable rust feature. Here is
a quick list.  We will go through each of these in order below. As I mentioned
before, not all of these are needed for every type of contribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea discussion/Pre-RFC</strong>  A Pre-RFC is an early draft or design discussion
of a feature. This stage is intended to flesh out the design space a bit and
get a grasp on the different merits and problems with an idea. It's a great
way to get early feedback on your idea before presenting it the wider
audience. You can find the original discussion <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-at-most-one-repetition-macro-patterns/6557">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>RFC</strong>  This is when you formally present your idea to the community for
consideration. You can find the RFC <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong> Implement your idea unstabley in the compiler. You can
find the original implementation <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47752">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Possibly iterate/refine</strong> As the community gets experience with your
feature on the nightly compiler and in <code>libstd</code>, there may be additional
feedback about design choice that might be adjusted. This particular feature
went <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49719">through</a> a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51336">number</a> of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51587">iterations</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization</strong> When your feature has baked enough, a rust team member may
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433177613">propose to stabilize it</a>. If there is consensus, this is done.</li>
<li><strong>Relax</strong> Your feature is now a stable rust feature!</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#pre-rfc-and-rfc" id="pre-rfc-and-rfc"><h2>Pre-RFC and RFC</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: In general, if you are not proposing a <em>new</em> feature or substantial
change to rust or the ecosystem, you don't need to follow the RFC process.
Instead, you can just jump to <a href="#impl">implementation</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the official guidelines for when to open an RFC <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#when-you-need-to-follow-this-process">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An RFC is a document that describes the feature or change you are proposing in
detail. Anyone can write an RFC; the process is the same for everyone,
including rust team members.</p>
<p>To open an RFC, open a PR on the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">rust-lang/rfcs</a> repo on GitHub. You can
find detailed instructions in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#what-the-process-is">README</a>.</p>
<p>Before opening an RFC, you should do the research to &quot;flesh out&quot; your idea.
Hastily-proposed RFCs tend not to be accepted. You should generally have a good
description of the motivation, impact, disadvantages, and potential
interactions with other features.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a lot of work, it's because it is. But no fear! Even if
you're not a compiler hacker, you can get great feedback by doing a <em>pre-RFC</em>.
This is an <em>informal</em> discussion of the idea. The best place to do this is
internals.rust-lang.org. Your post doesn't have to follow any particular
structure.  It doesn't even need to be a cohesive idea. Generally, you will get
tons of feedback that you can integrate back to produce a good RFC.</p>
<p>(Another pro-tip: try searching the RFCs repo and internals for prior related
ideas. A lot of times an idea has already been considered and was either
rejected or postponed to be tried again later. This can save you and everybody
else some time)</p>
<p>In the case of our example, a participant in the pre-RFC thread pointed out a
syntax ambiguity and a potential resolution. Also, the overall feedback seemed
positive. In this case, the discussion converged pretty quickly, but for some
ideas, a lot more discussion can happen (e.g. see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2457">this RFC</a> which
received a whopping 684 comments!). If that happens, don't be discouraged; it
means the community is interested in your idea, but it perhaps needs some
adjustments.</p>
<p>The RFC for our <code>?</code> macro feature did receive some discussion on the RFC thread
too.  As with most RFCs, there were a few questions that we couldn't answer by
discussion: we needed experience using the feature to decide. Such questions
are listed in the &quot;Unresolved Questions&quot; section of the RFC. Also, over the
course of the RFC discussion, you will probably want to update the RFC document
itself to reflect the course of the discussion (e.g. new alternatives or prior
work may be added or you may decide to change parts of the proposal itself).</p>
<p>In the end, when the discussion seems to reach a consensus and die down a bit,
a rust team member may propose to move to FCP with one of three possible dispositions.
This means that they want the other members of the appropriate teams to review
and comment on the RFC. More discussion may ensue, which may result in more changes
or unresolved questions being added. At some point, when everyone is
satisfied, the RFC enters the &quot;final comment period&quot; (FCP), which is the last
chance for people to bring up objections. When the FCP is over, the disposition is
adopted. Here are the three possible dispositions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Merge</em>: accept the feature. Here is the proposal to merge for our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298#issuecomment-360582667"><code>?</code> macro
feature</a>.</li>
<li><em>Close</em>: this feature in its current form is not a good fit for rust. Don't
be discouraged if this happens to your RFC, and don't take it personally.
This is not a reflection on you, but rather a community decision that rust
will go a different direction.</li>
<li><em>Postpone</em>: there is interest in going this direction but not at the moment.
This happens most often because the appropriate rust team doesn't have the
bandwidth to shepherd the feature through the process to stabilization. Often
this is the case when the feature doesn't fit into the team's roadmap.
Postponed ideas may be revisited later.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an RFC is merged, the PR is merged into the RFCs repo. A new <em>tracking
issue</em> is created in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a> repo to track progress on the feature
and discuss unresolved questions, implementation progress and blockers, etc.
Here is the tracking issue on for our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075"><code>?</code> macro feature</a>.</p>
<p><a name="impl"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#implementation" id="implementation"><h2>Implementation</h2></a>
<p>To make a change to the compiler, open a PR against the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a> repo.</p>
<p>Depending on the feature/change/bug fix/improvement, implementation may be
relatively-straightforward or it may be a major undertaking. You can always ask
for help or mentorship from more experienced compiler devs.  Also, you don't
have to be the one to implement your feature; but keep in mind that if you
don't it might be a while before someone else does.</p>
<p>For the <code>?</code> macro feature, I needed to go understand the relevant parts of
macro expansion in the compiler. Personally, I find that <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47732">improving the
comments</a> in the code is a helpful way of making sure I understand
it, but you don't have to do that if you don't want to.</p>
<p>I then <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47752">implemented</a> the original feature, as described in the RFC. When
a new feature is implemented, it goes behind a <em>feature gate</em>, which means that
you have to use <code>#![feature(my_feature_name)]</code> to use the feature. The feature
gate is removed when the feature is stabilized.</p>
<p><strong>Most bug fixes and improvements</strong> don't require a feature gate. You can just
make your changes/improvements.</p>
<p>When you open a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a>, a bot will assign your PR to a
review. If there is a particular rust team member you are working with, you can
request that reviewer by leaving a comment on the thread with <code>r? @reviewer-github-id</code> (e.g. <code>r? @eddyb</code>). If you don't know who to request,
don't request anyone; the bot will assign someone automatically.</p>
<p>The reviewer may request changes before they approve your PR. Feel free to ask
questions or discuss things you don't understand or disagree with. However,
recognize that the PR won't be merged unless someone on the rust team approves
it.</p>
<p>When your review approves the PR, it will go into a queue for yet another bot
called <code>@bors</code>.  <code>@bors</code> manages the CI build/merge queue. When your PR reaches
the head of the <code>@bors</code> queue, <code>@bors</code> will test out the merge by running all
tests against your PR on Travis CI. This takes about 2 hours as of this
writing.  If all tests pass, the PR is merged and becomes part of the next
nightly compiler!</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that may happen for some PRs during the review process</p>
<ul>
<li>If the change is substantial enough, the reviewer may request an FCP on
the PR. This gives all members of the appropriate team a chance to review the
changes.</li>
<li>If the change may cause breakage, the reviewer may request a <a href="./tests/intro.html#crater">crater</a> run.
This compiles the compiler with your changes and then attempts to compile all
crates on crates.io with your modified compiler. This is a great smoke test
to check if you introduced a change to compiler behavior that affects a large
portion of the ecosystem.</li>
<li>If the diff of your PR is large or the reviewer is busy, your PR may have
some merge conflicts with other PRs that happen to get merged first. You
should fix these merge conflicts using the normal git procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not doing a new feature or something like that (e.g. if you are
fixing a bug), then that's it! Thanks for your contribution :)</p>
<a class="header" href="#refining-your-implementation" id="refining-your-implementation"><h2>Refining your implementation</h2></a>
<p>As people get experience with your new feature on nightly, slight changes may
be proposed and unresolved questions may become resolved. Updates/changes go
through the same process for implementing any other changes, as described
above (i.e. submit a PR, go through review, wait for <code>@bors</code>, etc).</p>
<p>Some changes may be major enough to require an FCP and some review by rust team
members.</p>
<p>For the <code>?</code> macro feature, we went through a few different iterations after the
original implementation: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49719">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51336">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51587">3</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, we decided that <code>?</code> should not take a separator, which was
previously an unresolved question listed in the RFC. We also changed the
disambiguation strategy: we decided to remove the ability to use <code>?</code> as a
separator token for other repetition operators (e.g. <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>). However,
since this was a breaking change, we decided to do it over an edition boundary.
Thus, the new feature can be enabled only in edition 2018. These deviations
from the original RFC required <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51934">another
FCP</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stabilization" id="stabilization"><h2>Stabilization</h2></a>
<p>Finally, after the feature had baked for a while on nightly, a language team member
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433177613">moved to stabilize it</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>stabilization report</em> needs to be written that includes</p>
<ul>
<li>brief description of the behavior and any deviations from the RFC</li>
<li>which edition(s) are affected and how</li>
<li>links to a few tests to show the interesting aspects</li>
</ul>
<p>The stabilization report for our feature is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433243048">here</a>.</p>
<p>After this, [a PR is made][stab] to remove the feature gate, enabling the feature by
default (on the 2018 edition). A note is added to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md">Release notes</a>
about the feature.</p>
<p>Steps to stabilize the feature can be found at <a href="./stabilization_guide.html">Stabilizing Features</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implement-new-feature" id="implement-new-feature"><h1>Implement New Feature</h1></a>
<p>When you want to implement a new significant feature in the compiler,
you need to go through this process to make sure everything goes
smoothly.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-rfcbot-pfcp-process" id="the-rfcbot-pfcp-process"><h2>The @rfcbot (p)FCP process</h2></a>
<p>When the change is small and uncontroversial, then it can be done
with just writing a PR and getting r+ from someone who knows that
part of the code. However, if the change is potentially controversial,
it would be a bad idea to push it without consensus from the rest
of the team (both in the &quot;distributed system&quot; sense to make sure
you don't break anything you don't know about, and in the social
sense to avoid PR fights).</p>
<p>If such a change seems to be too small to require a full formal RFC
process (e.g. a big refactoring of the code, or a
&quot;technically-breaking&quot; change, or a &quot;big bugfix&quot; that basically
amounts to a small feature) but is still too controversial or
big to get by with a single r+, you can start a pFCP (or, if you
don't have r+ rights, ask someone who has them to start one - and
unless they have a concern themselves, they should).</p>
<p>Again, the pFCP process is only needed if you need consensus - if you
don't think anyone would have a problem with your change, it's ok to
get by with only an r+. For example, it is OK to add or modify
unstable command-line flags or attributes without an pFCP for
compiler development or standard library use, as long as you don't
expect them to be in wide use in the nightly ecosystem.</p>
<p>You don't need to have the implementation fully ready for r+ to ask
for a pFCP, but it is generally a good idea to have at least a proof
of concept so that people can see what you are talking about.</p>
<p>That starts a &quot;proposed final comment period&quot; (pFCP), which requires
all members of the team to sign off the FCP. After they all do so,
there's a week long &quot;final comment period&quot; where everybody can comment,
and if no new concerns are raised, the PR/issue gets FCP approval.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-logistics-of-writing-features" id="the-logistics-of-writing-features"><h2>The logistics of writing features</h2></a>
<p>There are a few &quot;logistic&quot; hoops you might need to go through in
order to implement a feature in a working way.</p>
<a class="header" href="#warning-cycles" id="warning-cycles"><h3>Warning Cycles</h3></a>
<p>In some cases, a feature or bugfix might break some existing programs
in some edge cases. In that case, you might want to do a crater run
to assess the impact and possibly add a future-compatibility lint,
similar to those used for
<a href="./diag.html#edition-gated-lints">edition-gated lints</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stability" id="stability"><h3>Stability</h3></a>
<p>We <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">value the stability of Rust</a>. Code that works and runs on stable
should (mostly) not break. Because of that, we don't want to release
a feature to the world with only team consensus and code review -
we want to gain real-world experience on using that feature on nightly,
and we might want to change the feature based on that experience.</p>
<p>To allow for that, we must make sure users don't accidentally depend
on that new feature - otherwise, especially if experimentation takes
time or is delayed and the feature takes the trains to stable,
it would end up de facto stable and we'll not be able to make changes
in it without breaking people's code.</p>
<p>The way we do that is that we make sure all new features are feature
gated - they can't be used without a enabling a feature gate
(<code>#[feature(foo)]</code>), which can't be done in a stable/beta compiler.
See the <a href="#stability-in-code">stability in code</a> section for the technical details.</p>
<p>Eventually, after we gain enough experience using the feature,
make the necessary changes, and are satisfied, we expose it to
the world using the stabilization process described <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustc-guide/stabilization_guide.html">here</a>.
Until then, the feature is not set in stone: every part of the
feature can be changed, or the feature might be completely
rewritten or removed. Features are not supposed to gain tenure
by being unstable and unchanged for a year.</p>
<p><a name = "tracking-issue"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#tracking-issues" id="tracking-issues"><h3>Tracking Issues</h3></a>
<p>To keep track of the status of an unstable feature, the
experience we get while using it on nightly, and of the
concerns that block its stabilization, every feature-gate
needs a tracking issue.</p>
<p>General discussions about the feature should be done on
the tracking issue.</p>
<p>For features that have an RFC, you should use the RFC's
tracking issue for the feature.</p>
<p>For other features, you'll have to make a tracking issue
for that feature. The issue title should be &quot;Tracking issue
for YOUR FEATURE&quot;.</p>
<p>For tracking issues for features (as opposed to future-compat
warnings), I don't think the description has to contain
anything specific. Generally we put the list of items required
for stabilization using a github list, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">    **Steps:**

    - [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @rust-lang/compiler -- can anyone write
          up mentoring instructions?)
    - [ ] Adjust documentation ([see instructions on forge][doc-guide])
    - Note: no stabilization step here.
</code></pre>
<p><a name="stability-in-code"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#stability-in-code" id="stability-in-code"><h2>Stability in code</h2></a>
<p>The below steps needs to be followed in order to implement
a new unstable feature:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a <a href="#tracking-issue">tracking issue</a> -
if you have an RFC, you can use the tracking issue for the RFC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a name for the feature gate (for RFCs, use the name
in the RFC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a feature gate declaration to <code>libsyntax/feature_gate.rs</code>
in the active <code>declare_features</code> block:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    // description of feature
    (active, $feature_name, &quot;$current_nightly_version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>$edition</code> has the type <code>Option&lt;Edition&gt;</code>, and is typically
just <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    // allow '|' at beginning of match arms (RFC 1925)
(   active, match_beginning_vert, &quot;1.21.0&quot;, Some(44101), None),
</code></pre>
<p>The current version is not actually important – the important
version is when you are stabilizing a feature.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Prevent usage of the new feature unless the feature gate is set.
You can check it in most places in the compiler using the
expression <code>tcx.features().$feature_name</code> (or
<code>sess.features_untracked().$feature_name</code> if the
tcx is unavailable)</p>
<p>If the feature gate is not set, you should either maintain
the pre-feature behavior or raise an error, depending on
what makes sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a test to ensure the feature cannot be used without
a feature gate, by creating <code>feature-gate-$feature_name.rs</code>
and <code>feature-gate-$feature_name.stderr</code> files under the
<code>src/test/ui/feature-gates</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a section to the unstable book, in
<code>src/doc/unstable-book/src/language-features/$feature_name.md</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a lots of tests for the new feature.
PRs without tests will not be accepted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get your PR reviewed and land it. You have now successfully
implemented a feature in Rust!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#request-for-stabilization" id="request-for-stabilization"><h1>Request for stabilization</h1></a>
<p>Once an unstable feature has been well-tested with no outstanding
concern, anyone may push for its stabilization. It involves the
following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation PRs</li>
<li>Write a stabilization report</li>
<li>FCP</li>
<li>Stabilization PR</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#documentation-prs" id="documentation-prs"><h2>Documentation PRs</h2></a>
<p><a name="updating-documentation"></a></p>
<p>If any documentation for this feature exists, it should be
in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/index.html"><code>Unstable Book</code></a>, located at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/doc/unstable-book"><code>src/doc/unstable-book</code></a>.
If it exists, the page for the feature gate should be removed.</p>
<p>If there was documentation there, integrating it into the
existing documentation is needed.</p>
<p>If there wasn't documentation there, it needs to be added.</p>
<p>Places that may need updated documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/reference">The Reference</a>: This must be updated, in full detail.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/book">The Book</a>: This may or may not need updating, depends.
If you're not sure, please open an issue on this repository
and it can be discussed.</li>
<li>standard library documentation: As needed. Language features
often don't need this, but if it's a feature that changes
how good examples are written, such as when <code>?</code> was added
to the language, updating examples is important.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example">Rust by Example</a>: As needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare PRs to update documentations invovling this new feature
for  repositories mentioned above. Maintainers of these repositories
will keep these PRs open until the whole stabilization process
has completed. Meanwhile, we can proceed to the next step.</p>
<a class="header" href="#write-a-stabilization-report" id="write-a-stabilization-report"><h2>Write a stabilization report</h2></a>
<p>Find the tracking issue of the feature, and create a short
stabilization report. Essentially this would be a brief summary
of the feature plus some links to test cases showing it works
as expected, along with a list of edge cases that came up and
and were considered. This is a minimal &quot;due diligence&quot; that
we do before stabilizing.</p>
<p>The report should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A summary, showing examples (e.g. code snippets) what is
enabled by this feature.</li>
<li>Links to test cases in our test suite regarding this feature
and describe the feature's behavior on encountering edge cases.</li>
<li>Links to the documentations (the PRs we have made in the
previous steps).</li>
<li>Any other relevant information(Examples of such reports can
be found in rust-lang/rust#44494 and rust-lang/rust#28237).</li>
<li>The resolutions of any unresolved questions if the stabilization
is for an RFC.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#fcp" id="fcp"><h2>FCP</h2></a>
<p>If any member of the team responsible for tracking this
feature agrees with stabilizing this feature, they will
start the FCP (final-comment-period) process by commenting</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">@rfcbot fcp merge
</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the team members will review the proposal. If the final
decision is to stabilize, we proceed to do the actual code modification.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stabilization-pr" id="stabilization-pr"><h2>Stabilization PR</h2></a>
<p>Once we have decided to stabilize a feature, we need to have
a PR that actually makes that stabilization happen. These kinds
of PRs are a great way to get involved in Rust, as they take
you on a little tour through the source code.</p>
<p>Here is a general guide to how to stabilize a feature --
every feature is different, of course, so some features may
require steps beyond what this guide talks about.</p>
<p>Note: Before we stabilize any feature, it's the rule that it
should appear in the documentation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#updating-the-feature-gate-listing" id="updating-the-feature-gate-listing"><h3>Updating the feature-gate listing</h3></a>
<p>There is a central listing of feature-gates in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/feature_gate/index.html"><code>src/libsyntax/feature_gate.rs</code></a>. Search for the <code>declare_features!</code>
macro. There should be an entry for the feature you are aiming
to stabilize, something like (this example is taken from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32409">rust-lang/rust#32409</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// pub(restricted) visibilities (RFC 1422)
(active, pub_restricted, &quot;1.9.0&quot;, Some(32409)),
</code></pre>
<p>The above line should be moved down to the area for &quot;accepted&quot;
features, declared below in a separate call to <code>declare_features!</code>.
When it is done, it should look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// pub(restricted) visibilities (RFC 1422)
(accepted, pub_restricted, &quot;1.31.0&quot;, Some(32409)),
// note that we changed this
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, the version number is updated to be the version number
of the stable release where this feature will appear. This can be
found by consulting <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/">the forge</a>, which will guide
you the next stable release number. You want to add 1 to that,
because the code that lands today will become go into beta on that
date, and then become stable after that. So, at the time of this
writing, the next stable release (i.e. what is currently beta) was
1.30.0, hence I wrote 1.31.0 above.</p>
<a class="header" href="#removing-existing-uses-of-the-feature-gate" id="removing-existing-uses-of-the-feature-gate"><h3>Removing existing uses of the feature-gate</h3></a>
<p>Next search for the feature string (in this case, <code>pub_restricted</code>)
in the codebase to find where it appears. Change uses of
<code>#![feature(XXX)]</code> from the <code>libstd</code> and any rustc crates to be
<code>#![cfg_attr(stage0, feature(XXX))]</code>. This includes the feature-gate
only for stage0, which is built using the current beta (this is
needed because the feature is still unstable in the current beta).</p>
<p>Also, remove those strings from any tests. If there are tests
specifically targeting the feature-gate (i.e., testing that the
feature-gate is required to use the feature, but nothing else),
simply remove the test.</p>
<a class="header" href="#do-not-require-the-feature-gate-to-use-the-feature" id="do-not-require-the-feature-gate-to-use-the-feature"><h3>Do not require the feature-gate to use the feature</h3></a>
<p>Most importantly, remove the code which flags an error if the
feature-gate is not present (since the feature is now considered
stable). If the feature can be detected because it employs some
new syntax, then a common place for that code to be is in the
same <code>feature_gate.rs</code>. For example, you might see code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">gate_feature_post!(&amp;self, pub_restricted, span,
 &quot;`pub(restricted)` syntax is experimental&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>gate_feature_post!</code> macro prints an error if the
<code>pub_restricted</code> feature is not enabled. It is not needed
now that <code>#[pub_restricted]</code> is stable.</p>
<p>For more subtle features, you may find code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted { /* XXX */ }
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>pub_restricted</code> field (obviously named after the feature)
would ordinarily be false if the feature flag is not present
and true if it is. So transform the code to assume that the field
is true. In this case, that would mean removing the <code>if</code> and
leaving just the <code>/* XXX */</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted { /* XXX */ }
becomes
/* XXX */

if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted &amp;&amp; something { /* XXX */ }
 becomes
if something { /* XXX */ }
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#debugging-the-compiler" id="debugging-the-compiler"><h1>Debugging the compiler</h1></a>
<p>This chapter contains a few tips to debug the compiler. These tips aim to be
useful no matter what you are working on.  Some of the other chapters have
advice about specific parts of the compiler (e.g. the <a href="./incrcomp-debugging.html">Queries Debugging and
Testing
chapter</a> or
the <a href="./codegen/debugging.html">LLVM Debugging chapter</a>).</p>
<a class="header" href="#-z-flags" id="-z-flags"><h2><code>-Z</code> flags</h2></a>
<p>The compiler has a bunch of <code>-Z</code> flags. These are unstable flags that are only
enabled on nightly. Many of them are useful for debugging. To get a full listing
of <code>-Z</code> flags, use <code>-Z help</code>.</p>
<p>One useful flag is <code>-Z verbose</code>, which generally enables printing more info that
could be useful for debugging.</p>
<a class="header" href="#getting-a-backtrace" id="getting-a-backtrace"><h2>Getting a backtrace</h2></a>
<p>When you have an ICE (panic in the compiler), you can set
<code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code> to get the stack trace of the <code>panic!</code> like in
normal Rust programs.  IIRC backtraces <strong>don't work</strong> on Mac and on MinGW,
sorry. If you have trouble or the backtraces are full of <code>unknown</code>,
you might want to find some way to use Linux or MSVC on Windows.</p>
<p>In the default configuration, you don't have line numbers enabled, so the
backtrace looks like this:</p>

<p>If you want to get a backtrace to the point where the compiler emits
an error message, you can pass the <code>-Z treat-err-as-bug</code>, which
will make the compiler panic on the first error it sees.</p>
<p>This can also help when debugging <code>delay_span_bug</code> calls - it will make
the first <code>delay_span_bug</code> call panic, which will give you a useful backtrace.</p>

<a class="header" href="#getting-logging-output" id="getting-logging-output"><h2>Getting logging output</h2></a>
<p>These crates are used in compiler for logging:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/log/0.4.6/log/index.html">log</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.4.3/env_logger/">env-logger</a>: check the link to see the full <code>RUST_LOG</code> syntax</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler has a lot of <code>debug!</code> calls, which print out logging information
at many points. These are very useful to at least narrow down the location of
a bug if not to find it entirely, or just to orient yourself as to why the
compiler is doing a particular thing.</p>
<p>To see the logs, you need to set the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable to
your log filter, e.g. to get the logs for a specific module, you can run the
compiler as <code>RUST_LOG=module::path rustc my-file.rs</code>. All <code>debug!</code> output will
then appear in standard error.</p>
<p><strong>Note that unless you use a very strict filter, the logger will emit a lot of
output, so use the most specific module(s) you can (comma-separated if
multiple)</strong>. It's typically a good idea to pipe standard error to a file and
look at the log output with a text editor.</p>
<p>So to put it together.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># This puts the output of all debug calls in `librustc/traits` into
# standard error, which might fill your console backscroll.
$ RUST_LOG=rustc::traits rustc +local my-file.rs

# This puts the output of all debug calls in `librustc/traits` in
# `traits-log`, so you can then see it with a text editor.
$ RUST_LOG=rustc::traits rustc +local my-file.rs 2&gt;traits-log

# Not recommended. This will show the output of all `debug!` calls
# in the Rust compiler, and there are a *lot* of them, so it will be
# hard to find anything.
$ RUST_LOG=debug rustc +local my-file.rs 2&gt;all-log

# This will show the output of all `info!` calls in `rustc_trans`.
#
# There's an `info!` statement in `trans_instance` that outputs
# every function that is translated. This is useful to find out
# which function triggers an LLVM assertion, and this is an `info!`
# log rather than a `debug!` log so it will work on the official
# compilers.
$ RUST_LOG=rustc_trans=info rustc +local my-file.rs

<p>While calls to <code>error!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>info!</code> are included in every build of the compiler,
calls to <code>debug!</code> and <code>trace!</code> are only included in the program if
<code>debug-assertions=yes</code> is turned on in config.toml (it is
turned off by default), so if you don't see <code>DEBUG</code> logs, especially
if you run the compiler with <code>RUST_LOG=rustc rustc some.rs</code> and only see
<code>INFO</code> logs, make sure that <code>debug-assertions=yes</code> is turned on in your
config.toml.</p>
<p>I also think that in some cases just setting it will not trigger a rebuild,
so if you changed it and you already have a compiler built, you might
want to call <code>x.py clean</code> to force one.</p>
<a class="header" href="#logging-etiquette-and-conventions" id="logging-etiquette-and-conventions"><h3>Logging etiquette and conventions</h3></a>
<p>Because calls to <code>debug!</code> are removed by default, in most cases, don't worry
about adding &quot;unnecessary&quot; calls to <code>debug!</code> and leaving them in code you
commit - they won't slow down the performance of what we ship, and if they
helped you pinning down a bug, they will probably help someone else with a
different one.</p>
<p>A loosely followed convention is to use <code>debug!(&quot;foo(...)&quot;)</code> at the <em>start</em> of
a function <code>foo</code> and <code>debug!(&quot;foo: ...&quot;)</code> <em>within</em> the function. Another
loosely followed convention is to use the <code>{:?}</code> format specifier for debug
logs.</p>
<p>One thing to be <strong>careful</strong> of is <strong>expensive</strong> operations in logs.</p>
<p>If in the module <code>rustc::foo</code> you have a statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">debug!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, random_operation(tcx));
</code></pre>
<p>Then if someone runs a debug <code>rustc</code> with <code>RUST_LOG=rustc::bar</code>, then
<code>random_operation()</code> will run.</p>
<p>This means that you should not put anything too expensive or likely to crash
there - that would annoy anyone who wants to use logging for their own module.
No-one will know it until someone tries to use logging to find <em>another</em> bug.</p>
<a class="header" href="#formatting-graphviz-output-dot-files" id="formatting-graphviz-output-dot-files"><h2>Formatting Graphviz output (.dot files)</h2></a>
<p>Some compiler options for debugging specific features yield graphviz graphs -
e.g. the <code>#[rustc_mir(borrowck_graphviz_postflow=&quot;suffix.dot&quot;)]</code> attribute
dumps various borrow-checker dataflow graphs.</p>
<p>These all produce <code>.dot</code> files. To view these files, install graphviz (e.g.
<code>apt-get install graphviz</code>) and then run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ dot -T pdf maybe_init_suffix.dot &gt; maybe_init_suffix.pdf

it is often a good idea to just add <code>-Zself-profile</code> option to the

to break out a custom profiler.</p>

<a class="header" href="#gathering-a-perf-profile" id="gathering-a-perf-profile"><h2>Gathering a perf profile</h2></a>
<p>perf is an excellent tool on linux that can be used to gather and
analyze all kinds of information. Mostly it is used to figure out
where a program spends its time. It can also be used for other sorts
of events, though, like cache misses and so forth.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-basics" id="the-basics"><h3>The basics</h3></a>
<p>The basic <code>perf</code> command is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf XXX
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-F99</code> tells perf to sample at 99 Hz, which avoids generating too
much data for longer runs (why 99 Hz you ask? It is often chosen
because it is unlikely to be in lockstep with other periodic
activity). The <code>--call-graph dwarf</code> tells perf to get call-graph
information from debuginfo, which is accurate. The <code>XXX</code> is the
command you want to profile. So, for example, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; rustc
</code></pre>
<p>to run <code>cargo</code> -- here <code>&lt;toolchain&gt;</code> should be the name of the toolchain
you made in the beginning. But there are some things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>You probably don't want to profile the time spend building
dependencies. So something like <code>cargo build; cargo clean -p $C</code> may
be helpful (where <code>$C</code> is the crate name)
<ul>
<li>Though usually I just do <code>touch src/lib.rs</code> and rebuild instead. =)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You probably don't want incremental messing about with your
profile. So something like <code>CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0</code> can be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#gathering-a-perf-profile-from-a-perfrust-langorg-test" id="gathering-a-perf-profile-from-a-perfrust-langorg-test"><h3>Gathering a perf profile from a <code>perf.rust-lang.org</code> test</h3></a>
<p>Often we want to analyze a specific test from <code>perf.rust-lang.org</code>. To
do that, the first step is to clone
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf">the rustc-perf repository</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; git clone https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#doing-it-the-easy-way" id="doing-it-the-easy-way"><h4>Doing it the easy way</h4></a>
<p>Once you've cloned the repo, you can use the <code>collector</code> executable to
do profiling for you! You can find
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/README.md#profiling">instructions in the rustc-perf readme</a>.</p>
<p>For example, to measure the clap-rs test, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ./target/release/collector
    --output-repo /path/to/place/output
    profile perf-record
    --rustc /path/to/rustc/executable/from/your/build/directory
    --cargo `which cargo`
    --filter clap-rs
    --builds Check
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use that same command to use cachegrind or other profiling tools.</p>
<a class="header" href="#doing-it-the-hard-way" id="doing-it-the-hard-way"><h4>Doing it the hard way</h4></a>
<p>If you prefer to run things manually, that is also possible. You first
need to find the source for the test you want. Sources for the tests
are found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/benchmarks">the <code>collector/benchmarks</code> directory</a>. So let's go
into the directory of a specific test; we'll use <code>clap-rs</code> as an
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cd collector/benchmarks/clap-rs
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, let's say we want to profile the <code>cargo check</code>
performance. In that case, I would first run some basic commands to
build the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Setup: first clean out any old results and build the dependencies:
&gt; cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; clean
&gt; CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; check
</code></pre>
<p>(Again, <code>&lt;toolchain&gt;</code> should be replaced with the name of the
toolchain we made in the first step.)</p>
<p>Next: we want record the execution time for <em>just</em> the clap-rs crate,
running cargo check. I tend to use <code>cargo rustc</code> for this, since it
also allows me to add explicit flags, which we'll do later on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; touch src/lib.rs
&gt; CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo rustc --profile check --lib
</code></pre>
<p>Note that final command: it's a doozy! It uses the <code>cargo rustc</code>
command, which executes rustc with (potentially) additional options;
the <code>--profile check</code> and <code>--lib</code> options specify that we are doing a
<code>cargo check</code> execution, and that this is a library (not a binary).</p>
<p>At this point, we can use <code>perf</code> tooling to analyze the results. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf report
</code></pre>
<p>will open up an interactive TUI program. In simple cases, that can be
helpful. For more detailed examination, the <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/perf-focus"><code>perf-focus</code> tool</a>
can be helpful; it is covered below.</p>
<p><strong>A note of caution.</strong> Each of the rustc-perf tests is its own special
snowflake. In particular, some of them are not libraries, in which
case you would want to do <code>touch src/main.rs</code> and avoid passing
<code>--lib</code>. I'm not sure how best to tell which test is which to be
honest.</p>
<a class="header" href="#gathering-nll-data" id="gathering-nll-data"><h3>Gathering NLL data</h3></a>
<p>If you want to profile an NLL run, you can just pass extra options to
the <code>cargo rustc</code> command, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; touch src/lib.rs
&gt; CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo rustc --profile check --lib -- -Zborrowck=mir
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#analyzing-a-perf-profile-with-perf-focus" id="analyzing-a-perf-profile-with-perf-focus"><h2>Analyzing a perf profile with <code>perf focus</code></h2></a>
<p>Once you've gathered a perf profile, we want to get some information
about it. For this, I personally use <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/perf-focus">perf focus</a>. It's a kind of
simple but useful tool that lets you answer queries like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F&quot; (no matter where it was called from)</li>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F when it was called from G&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F <em>excluding</em> time spent in G&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;what functions does F call and how much time does it spend in them&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand how it works, you have to know just a bit about
perf. Basically, perf works by <em>sampling</em> your process on a regular
basis (or whenever some event occurs). For each sample, perf gathers a
backtrace. <code>perf focus</code> lets you write a regular expression that tests
which functions appear in that backtrace, and then tells you which
percentage of samples had a backtrace that met the regular
expression. It's probably easiest to explain by walking through how I
would analyze NLL performance.</p>
<a class="header" href="#installing-perf-focus" id="installing-perf-focus"><h3>Installing <code>perf-focus</code></h3></a>
<p>You can install perf-focus using <code>cargo install</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cargo install perf-focus
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#example-how-much-time-is-spent-in-mir-borrowck" id="example-how-much-time-is-spent-in-mir-borrowck"><h3>Example: How much time is spent in MIR borrowck?</h3></a>
<p>Let's say we've gathered the NLL data for a test. We'd like to know
how much time it is spending in the MIR borrow-checker. The &quot;main&quot;
function of the MIR borrowck is called <code>do_mir_borrowck</code>, so we can do
this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}'
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}
Matches    : 228
Not Matches: 542
Percentage : 29%
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'{do_mir_borrowck}'</code> argument is called the <strong>matcher</strong>. It
specifies the test to be applied on the backtrace. In this case, the
<code>{X}</code> indicates that there must be <em>some</em> function on the backtrace
that meets the regular expression <code>X</code>. In this case, that regex is
just the name of the function we want (in fact, it's a subset of the name;
the full name includes a bunch of other stuff, like the module
path). In this mode, perf-focus just prints out the percentage of
samples where <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> was on the stack: in this case, 29%.</p>
<p><strong>A note about c++filt.</strong> To get the data from <code>perf</code>, <code>perf focus</code>
currently executes <code>perf script</code> (perhaps there is a better
way...). I've sometimes found that <code>perf script</code> outputs C++ mangled
names. This is annoying. You can tell by running <code>perf script | head</code> yourself — if you see names like <code>5rustc6middle</code> instead of
<code>rustc::middle</code>, then you have the same problem. You can solve this
by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf script | c++filt | perf focus --from-stdin ...
</code></pre>
<p>This will pipe the output from <code>perf script</code> through <code>c++filt</code> and
should mostly convert those names into a more friendly format. The
<code>--from-stdin</code> flag to <code>perf focus</code> tells it to get its data from
stdin, rather than executing <code>perf focus</code>. We should make this more
convenient (at worst, maybe add a <code>c++filt</code> option to <code>perf focus</code>, or
just always use it — it's pretty harmless).</p>
<a class="header" href="#example-how-much-time-does-mir-borrowck-spend-solving-traits" id="example-how-much-time-does-mir-borrowck-spend-solving-traits"><h3>Example: How much time does MIR borrowck spend solving traits?</h3></a>
<p>Perhaps we'd like to know how much time MIR borrowck spends in the
trait checker. We can ask this using a more complex regex:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}..{^rustc::traits}'
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck},..{^rustc::traits}
Matches    : 12
Not Matches: 1311
Percentage : 0%
</code></pre>
<p>Here we used the <code>..</code> operator to ask &quot;how often do we have
<code>do_mir_borrowck</code> on the stack and then, later, some function whose
name begins with <code>rusc::traits</code>?&quot; (basically, code in that module). It
turns out the answer is &quot;almost never&quot; — only 12 samples fit that
description (if you ever see <em>no</em> samples, that often indicates your
query is messed up).</p>
<p>If you're curious, you can find out exactly which samples by using the
<code>--print-match</code> option. This will print out the full backtrace for
each sample. The <code>|</code> at the front of the line indicates the part that
the regular expression matched.</p>
<a class="header" href="#example-where-does-mir-borrowck-spend-its-time" id="example-where-does-mir-borrowck-spend-its-time"><h3>Example: Where does MIR borrowck spend its time?</h3></a>
<p>Often we want to do a more &quot;explorational&quot; queries. Like, we know that
MIR borrowck is 29% of the time, but where does that time get spent?
For that, the <code>--tree-callees</code> option is often the best tool. You
usually also want to give <code>--tree-min-percent</code> or
<code>--tree-max-depth</code>. The result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}' --tree-callees --tree-min-percent 3
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}
Matches    : 577

</code></pre>
<p>What happens with <code>--tree-callees</code> is that</p>
<ul>
<li>we find each sample matching the regular expression</li>
<li>we look at the code that is occurs <em>after</em> the regex match and try
to build up a call tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>--tree-min-percent 3</code> option says &quot;only show me things that take
more than 3% of the time. Without this, the tree often gets really
noisy and includes random stuff like the innards of
malloc. <code>--tree-max-depth</code> can be useful too, it just limits how many
levels we print.</p>
<p>For each line, we display the percent of time in that function
altogether (&quot;total&quot;) and the percent of time spent in <strong>just that
function and not some callee of that function</strong> (self). Usually
&quot;total&quot; is the more interesting number, but not always.</p>
<a class="header" href="#relative-percentages" id="relative-percentages"><h3>Relative percentages</h3></a>
<p>By default, all in perf-focus are relative to the <strong>total program
execution</strong>. This is useful to help you keep perspective — often as
we drill down to find hot spots, we can lose sight of the fact that,
in terms of overall program execution, this &quot;hot spot&quot; is actually not
important. It also ensures that percentages between different queries
are easily compared against one another.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes it's useful to get relative percentages, so <code>perf focus</code> offers a <code>--relative</code> option. In this case, the percentages are
listed only for samples that match (vs all samples). So for example we
could get our percentages relative to the borrowck itself
like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}' --tree-callees --relative --tree-max-depth 1 --tree-min-percent 5
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}

means that 47% of <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> is spent in that function. Before,

<p>Beyond formatting, there are a few other tips that are worth
following.</p>
<a class="header" href="#prefer-exhaustive-matches" id="prefer-exhaustive-matches"><h2>Prefer exhaustive matches</h2></a>
<p>Using <code>_</code> in a match is convenient, but it means that when new
variants are added to the enum, they may not get handled correctly.
Ask yourself: if a new variant were added to this enum, what's the
chance that it would want to use the <code>_</code> code, versus having some
other treatment?  Unless the answer is &quot;low&quot;, then prefer an
exhaustive match. (The same advice applies to <code>if let</code> and <code>while let</code>, which are effectively tests for a single variant.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#use-todo-comments-for-things-you-dont-want-to-forget" id="use-todo-comments-for-things-you-dont-want-to-forget"><h2>Use &quot;TODO&quot; comments for things you don't want to forget</h2></a>
<p>As a useful tool to yourself, you can insert a <code>// TODO</code> comment
for something that you want to get back to before you land your PR:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn do_something() {
    if something_else {
        unimplemented!(); // TODO write this
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The tidy script will report an error for a <code>// TODO</code> comment, so this
code would not be able to land until the TODO is fixed (or removed).</p>
<p>This can also be useful in a PR as a way to signal from one commit that you are
leaving a bug that a later commit will fix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if foo {
    return true; // TODO wrong, but will be fixed in a later commit
}

<a class="header" href="#how-to-structure-your-pr" id="how-to-structure-your-pr"><h1>How to structure your PR</h1></a>
<p>How you prepare the commits in your PR can make a big difference for the
reviewer.  Here are some tips.</p>
<p><strong>Isolate &quot;pure refactorings&quot; into their own commit.</strong> For example, if
you rename a method, then put that rename into its own commit, along
with the renames of all the uses.</p>
<p><strong>More commits is usually better.</strong> If you are doing a large change,
it's almost always better to break it up into smaller steps that can
be independently understood. The one thing to be aware of is that if
you introduce some code following one strategy, then change it
dramatically (versus adding to it) in a later commit, that
'back-and-forth' can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>If you run rustfmt and the file was not already formatted, isolate
that into its own commit.</strong> This is really the same as the previous
rule, but it's worth highlighting. It's ok to rustfmt files, but since
we do not currently run rustfmt all the time, that can introduce a lot
of noise into your commit. Please isolate that into its own
commit. This also makes rebases a lot less painful, since rustfmt
tends to cause a lot of merge conflicts, and having those isolated
into their own commit makes them easier to resolve.</p>
<p><strong>No merges.</strong> We do not allow merge commits into our history, other
than those by bors. If you get a merge conflict, rebase instead via a
command like <code>git rebase -i rust-lang/master</code> (presuming you use the
name <code>rust-lang</code> for your remote).</p>
<p><strong>Individual commits do not have to build (but it's nice).</strong> We do not
require that every intermediate commit successfully builds – we only
expect to be able to bisect at a PR level. However, if you <em>can</em> make
individual commits build, that is always helpful.</p>
<a class="header" href="#naming-conventions" id="naming-conventions"><h1>Naming conventions</h1></a>
<p>Apart from normal Rust style/naming conventions, there are also some specific
to the compiler.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cx</code> tends to be short for &quot;context&quot; and is often used as a suffix. For
example, <code>tcx</code> is a common name for the <a href="./ty.html">Typing Context</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./ty.html"><code>'tcx</code> and <code>'gcx</code></a> are used as the lifetime names for the Typing
Context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because <code>crate</code> is a keyword, if you need a variable to represent something
crate-related, often the spelling is changed to <code>krate</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#cratesio-dependencies" id="cratesio-dependencies"><h1>crates.io Dependencies</h1></a>
<p>The rust compiler supports building with some dependencies from <code>crates.io</code>.
For example, <code>log</code> and <code>env_logger</code> come from <code>crates.io</code>.</p>
<p>In general, you should avoid adding dependencies to the compiler for several
reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dependency may not be high quality or well-maintained, whereas we want
the compiler to be high-quality.</li>
<li>The dependency may not be using a compatible license.</li>
<li>The dependency may have transitive dependencies that have one of the above
problems.</li>

<a class="header" href="#crate-structure" id="crate-structure"><h2>Crate structure</h2></a>
<p>The main Rust repository consists of a <code>src</code> directory, under which
there live many crates. These crates contain the sources for the
standard library and the compiler.  This document, of course, focuses
on the latter.</p>
<p>Rustc consists of a number of crates, including <code>syntax</code>,
<code>rustc</code>, <code>rustc_back</code>, <code>rustc_codegen</code>, <code>rustc_driver</code>, and
many more. The source for each crate can be found in a directory
like <code>src/libXXX</code>, where <code>XXX</code> is the crate name.</p>
<p>(N.B. The names and divisions of these crates are not set in
stone and may change over time. For the time being, we tend towards a
finer-grained division to help with compilation time, though as incremental
compilation improves, that may change.)</p>
<p>The dependency structure of these crates is roughly a diamond:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">                  rustc_driver
                /      |       \

                  /       \
           syntax_pos  syntax_ext
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rustc_driver</code> crate, at the top of this lattice, is effectively
the &quot;main&quot; function for the rust compiler. It doesn't have much &quot;real
code&quot;, but instead ties together all of the code defined in the other
crates and defines the overall flow of execution. (As we transition
more and more to the <a href="query.html">query model</a>, however, the
&quot;flow&quot; of compilation is becoming less centrally defined.)</p>
<p>At the other extreme, the <code>rustc</code> crate defines the common and
pervasive data structures that all the rest of the compiler uses
(e.g. how to represent types, traits, and the program itself). It
also contains some amount of the compiler itself, although that is
relatively limited.</p>
<p>Finally, all the crates in the bulge in the middle define the bulk of
the compiler – they all depend on <code>rustc</code>, so that they can make use
of the various types defined there, and they export public routines
that <code>rustc_driver</code> will invoke as needed (more and more, what these
crates export are &quot;query definitions&quot;, but those are covered later
on).</p>
<p>Below <code>rustc</code> lie various crates that make up the parser and error
reporting mechanism. For historical reasons, these crates do not have
the <code>rustc_</code> prefix, but they are really just as much an internal part
of the compiler and not intended to be stable (though they do wind up
getting used by some crates in the wild; a practice we hope to
gradually phase out).</p>
<p>Each crate has a <code>README.md</code> file that describes, at a high-level,
what it contains, and tries to give some kind of explanation (some
better than others).</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-main-stages-of-compilation" id="the-main-stages-of-compilation"><h2>The main stages of compilation</h2></a>
<p>The Rust compiler is in a bit of transition right now. It used to be a
purely &quot;pass-based&quot; compiler, where we ran a number of passes over the
entire program, and each did a particular check of transformation. We
are gradually replacing this pass-based code with an alternative setup
based on on-demand <strong>queries</strong>. In the query-model, we work backwards,
executing a <em>query</em> that expresses our ultimate goal (e.g. &quot;compile
this crate&quot;). This query in turn may make other queries (e.g. &quot;get me
a list of all modules in the crate&quot;). Those queries make other queries
that ultimately bottom out in the base operations, like parsing the
input, running the type-checker, and so forth. This on-demand model
permits us to do exciting things like only do the minimal amount of
work needed to type-check a single function. It also helps with
incremental compilation. (For details on defining queries, check out
the <a href="query.html">query model</a>.)</p>
<p>Regardless of the general setup, the basic operations that the
compiler must perform are the same. The only thing that changes is
whether these operations are invoked front-to-back, or on demand.  In
order to compile a Rust crate, these are the general steps that we
take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parsing input</strong>
<ul>
<li>this processes the <code>.rs</code> files and produces the AST
(&quot;abstract syntax tree&quot;)</li>
<li>the AST is defined in <code>src/libsyntax/ast.rs</code>. It is intended to match the lexical
syntax of the Rust language quite closely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Name resolution, macro expansion, and configuration</strong>
<ul>
<li>once parsing is complete, we process the AST recursively, resolving
paths and expanding macros. This same process also processes <code>#[cfg]</code>
nodes, and hence may strip things out of the AST as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lowering to HIR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once name resolution completes, we convert the AST into the HIR,
or &quot;<a href="hir.html">high-level intermediate representation</a>&quot;. The HIR is defined in
<code>src/librustc/hir/</code>; that module also includes the <a href="lowering.html">lowering</a> code.</li>
<li>The HIR is a lightly desugared variant of the AST. It is more processed
than the AST and more suitable for the analyses that follow.
It is <strong>not</strong> required to match the syntax of the Rust language.</li>
<li>As a simple example, in the <strong>AST</strong>, we preserve the parentheses
that the user wrote, so <code>((1 + 2) + 3)</code> and <code>1 + 2 + 3</code> parse
into distinct trees, even though they are equivalent. In the
HIR, however, parentheses nodes are removed, and those two
expressions are represented in the same way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Type-checking and subsequent analyses</strong>
<ul>
<li>An important step in processing the HIR is to perform type
checking. This process assigns types to every HIR expression,
for example, and also is responsible for resolving some
&quot;type-dependent&quot; paths, such as field accesses (<code>x.f</code> – we
can't know what field <code>f</code> is being accessed until we know the
type of <code>x</code>) and associated type references (<code>T::Item</code> – we
can't know what type <code>Item</code> is until we know what <code>T</code> is).</li>
<li>Type checking creates &quot;side-tables&quot; (<code>TypeckTables</code>) that include
the types of expressions, the way to resolve methods, and so forth.</li>
<li>After type-checking, we can do other analyses, such as privacy checking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Lowering to MIR and post-processing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once type-checking is done, we can lower the HIR into MIR (&quot;middle IR&quot;),
which is a <strong>very</strong> desugared version of Rust, well suited to borrowck
but also to certain high-level optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Translation to LLVM and LLVM optimizations</strong>
<ul>
<li>From MIR, we can produce LLVM IR.</li>
<li>LLVM then runs its various optimizations, which produces a number of
<code>.o</code> files (one for each &quot;codegen unit&quot;).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Linking</strong>
<ul>
<li>Finally, those <code>.o</code> files are linked together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#the-rustc-driver-and-interface" id="the-rustc-driver-and-interface"><h1>The Rustc Driver and Interface</h1></a>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/"><code>rustc_driver</code></a> is essentially <code>rustc</code>'s <code>main()</code> function. It acts as
the glue for running the various phases of the compiler in the correct order,
using the interface defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> crate.</p>
<p>The <code>rustc_interface</code> crate provides external users with an (unstable) API
for running code at particular times during the compilation process, allowing
third parties to effectively use <code>rustc</code>'s internals as a library for
analysing a crate or emulating the compiler in-process (e.g. the RLS or rustdoc).</p>
<p>For those using <code>rustc</code> as a library, the <code>interface::run_compiler()</code> function is the main
entrypoint to the compiler. It takes a configuration for the compiler and a closure that
takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Compiler.html"><code>Compiler</code></a>. <code>run_compiler</code> creates a <code>Compiler</code> from the configuration and passes
it to the closure. Inside the closure, you can use the <code>Compiler</code> to drive queries to compile
a crate and get the results. This is what the <code>rustc_driver</code> does too.</p>
<p>You can see what queries are currently available through the rustdocs for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Compiler.html"><code>Compiler</code></a>.
You can see an example of how to use them by looking at the <code>rustc_driver</code> implementation,
specifically the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/fn.run_compiler.html"><code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> function</a> (not to be confused with
<code>interface::run_compiler</code>). The <code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> function takes a bunch of
command-line args and some other configurations and drives the compilation to completion.</p>
<p><code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> also takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/trait.Callbacks.html"><code>Callbacks</code></a>. In the past, when
the <code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> was the primary way to use the compiler as a
library, these callbacks were used to have some custom code run after different
phases of the compilation. If you read <a href="appendix/stupid-stats.html">Appendix A</a>, you may notice the use of the
types <code>CompilerCalls</code> and <code>CompileController</code>, which no longer exist. <code>Callbacks</code>
replaces this functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> By its very nature, the internal compiler APIs are always going
to be unstable. That said, we do try not to break things unnecessarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#a-note-on-lifetimes" id="a-note-on-lifetimes"><h2>A Note On Lifetimes</h2></a>
<p>The Rust compiler is a fairly large program containing lots of big data
structures (e.g. the AST, HIR, and the type system) and as such, arenas and
references are heavily relied upon to minimize unnecessary memory use. This
manifests itself in the way people can plug into the compiler, preferring a
&quot;push&quot;-style API (callbacks) instead of the more Rust-ic &quot;pull&quot; style (think
the <code>Iterator</code> trait).</p>
<p>Thread-local storage and interning are used a lot through the compiler to reduce
duplication while also preventing a lot of the ergonomic issues due to many
pervasive lifetimes. The <code>rustc::ty::tls</code> module is used to access these
thread-locals, although you should rarely need to touch it.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-walking-tour-of-rustdoc" id="the-walking-tour-of-rustdoc"><h1>The walking tour of rustdoc</h1></a>
<p>Rustdoc actually uses the rustc internals directly. It lives in-tree with the
compiler and standard library. This chapter is about how it works.</p>
<p>Rustdoc is implemented entirely within the crate <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustdoc"><code>librustdoc</code></a>. It runs
the compiler up to the point where we have an internal representation of a
crate (HIR) and the ability to run some queries about the types of items. <a href="./hir.html">HIR</a>
and <a href="./query.html">queries</a> are discussed in the linked chapters.</p>
<p><code>librustdoc</code> performs two major steps after that to render a set of
documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Clean&quot; the AST into a form that's more suited to creating documentation (and
slightly more resistant to churn in the compiler).</li>
<li>Use this cleaned AST to render a crate's documentation, one page at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, there's more than just this, and those descriptions simplify out
lots of details, but that's the high-level overview.</p>
<p>(Side note: <code>librustdoc</code> is a library crate! The <code>rustdoc</code> binary is created
using the project in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustdoc"><code>src/tools/rustdoc</code></a>. Note that literally all that
does is call the <code>main()</code> that's in this crate's <code>lib.rs</code>, though.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#cheat-sheet" id="cheat-sheet"><h2>Cheat sheet</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>./x.py build --stage 1 src/libstd src/tools/rustdoc</code> to make a usable
rustdoc you can run on other projects.
<ul>
<li>Add <code>src/libtest</code> to be able to use <code>rustdoc --test</code>.</li>
<li>If you've used <code>rustup toolchain link local /path/to/build/$TARGET/stage1</code>
previously, then after the previous build command, <code>cargo +local doc</code> will

</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>./x.py doc --stage 1 src/libstd</code> to use this rustdoc to generate the

<ul>
<li>The completed docs will be available in <code>build/$TARGET/doc/std</code>, though the
bundle is meant to be used as though you would copy out the <code>doc</code> folder to
a web server, since that's where the CSS/JS and landing page are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most of the HTML printing code is in <code>html/format.rs</code> and <code>html/render.rs</code>.
It's in a bunch of <code>fmt::Display</code> implementations and supplementary
functions.</li>
<li>The types that got <code>Display</code> impls above are defined in <code>clean/mod.rs</code>, right
next to the custom <code>Clean</code> trait used to process them out of the rustc HIR.</li>
<li>The bits specific to using rustdoc as a test harness are in <code>test.rs</code>.</li>
<li>The Markdown renderer is loaded up in <code>html/markdown.rs</code>, including functions
for extracting doctests from a given block of Markdown.</li>
<li>The tests on rustdoc <em>output</em> are located in <code>src/test/rustdoc</code>, where
they're handled by the test runner of rustbuild and the supplementary script
<code>src/etc/htmldocck.py</code>.</li>
<li>Tests on search index generation are located in <code>src/test/rustdoc-js</code>, as a
series of JavaScript files that encode queries on the standard library search
index and expected results.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#from-crate-to-clean" id="from-crate-to-clean"><h2>From crate to clean</h2></a>
<p>In <code>core.rs</code> are two central items: the <code>DocContext</code> struct, and the <code>run_core</code>
function. The latter is where rustdoc calls out to rustc to compile a crate to
the point where rustdoc can take over. The former is a state container used
when crawling through a crate to gather its documentation.</p>
<p>The main process of crate crawling is done in <code>clean/mod.rs</code> through several
implementations of the <code>Clean</code> trait defined within. This is a conversion
trait, which defines one method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait Clean&lt;T&gt; {
    fn clean(&amp;self, cx: &amp;DocContext) -&gt; T;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>clean/mod.rs</code> also defines the types for the &quot;cleaned&quot; AST used later on to
render documentation pages. Each usually accompanies an implementation of
<code>Clean</code> that takes some AST or HIR type from rustc and converts it into the
appropriate &quot;cleaned&quot; type. &quot;Big&quot; items like modules or associated items may
have some extra processing in its <code>Clean</code> implementation, but for the most part
these impls are straightforward conversions. The &quot;entry point&quot; to this module
is the <code>impl Clean&lt;Crate&gt; for visit_ast::RustdocVisitor</code>, which is called by
<code>run_core</code> above.</p>
<p>You see, I actually lied a little earlier: There's another AST transformation
that happens before the events in <code>clean/mod.rs</code>.  In <code>visit_ast.rs</code> is the
type <code>RustdocVisitor</code>, which <em>actually</em> crawls a <code>hir::Crate</code> to get the first
intermediate representation, defined in <code>doctree.rs</code>. This pass is mainly to
get a few intermediate wrappers around the HIR types and to process visibility
and inlining. This is where <code>#[doc(inline)]</code>, <code>#[doc(no_inline)]</code>, and
<code>#[doc(hidden)]</code> are processed, as well as the logic for whether a <code>pub use</code>
should get the full page or a &quot;Reexport&quot; line in the module page.</p>
<p>The other major thing that happens in <code>clean/mod.rs</code> is the collection of doc
comments and <code>#[doc=&quot;&quot;]</code> attributes into a separate field of the Attributes
struct, present on anything that gets hand-written documentation. This makes it
easier to collect this documentation later in the process.</p>
<p>The primary output of this process is a <code>clean::Crate</code> with a tree of Items
which describe the publicly-documentable items in the target crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hot-potato" id="hot-potato"><h3>Hot potato</h3></a>
<p>Before moving on to the next major step, a few important &quot;passes&quot; occur over
the documentation.  These do things like combine the separate &quot;attributes&quot; into
a single string and strip leading whitespace to make the document easier on the
markdown parser, or drop items that are not public or deliberately hidden with
<code>#[doc(hidden)]</code>. These are all implemented in the <code>passes/</code> directory, one
file per pass. By default, all of these passes are run on a crate, but the ones
regarding dropping private/hidden items can be bypassed by passing
<code>--document-private-items</code> to rustdoc. Note that unlike the previous set of AST
transformations, the passes happen on the <em>cleaned</em> crate.</p>
<p>(Strictly speaking, you can fine-tune the passes run and even add your own, but
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44136">we're trying to deprecate that</a>. If you need finer-grain control over
these passes, please let us know!)</p>
<p>Here is current (as of this writing) list of passes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>propagate-doc-cfg</code> - propagates <code>#[doc(cfg(...))]</code> to child items.</li>
<li><code>collapse-docs</code> concatenates all document attributes into one document
attribute. This is necessary because each line of a doc comment is given as a
separate doc attribute, and this will combine them into a single string with
line breaks between each attribute.</li>
<li><code>unindent-comments</code> removes excess indentation on comments in order for
markdown to like it. This is necessary because the convention for writing
documentation is to provide a space between the <code>///</code> or <code>//!</code> marker and the
text, and stripping that leading space will make the text easier to parse by
the Markdown parser. (In the past, the markdown parser used was not
Commonmark- compliant, which caused annoyances with extra whitespace but this
seems to be less of an issue today.)</li>
<li><code>strip-priv-imports</code> strips all private import statements (<code>use</code>, <code>extern crate</code>) from a crate. This is necessary because rustdoc will handle <em>public</em>
imports by either inlining the item's documentation to the module or creating
a &quot;Reexports&quot; section with the import in it. The pass ensures that all of
these imports are actually relevant to documentation.</li>
<li><code>strip-hidden</code> and <code>strip-private</code> strip all <code>doc(hidden)</code> and private items
from the output. <code>strip-private</code> implies <code>strip-priv-imports</code>. Basically, the
goal is to remove items that are not relevant for public documentation.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#from-clean-to-crate" id="from-clean-to-crate"><h2>From clean to crate</h2></a>
<p>This is where the &quot;second phase&quot; in rustdoc begins. This phase primarily lives
in the <code>html/</code> folder, and it all starts with <code>run()</code> in <code>html/render.rs</code>. This
code is responsible for setting up the <code>Context</code>, <code>SharedContext</code>, and <code>Cache</code>
which are used during rendering, copying out the static files which live in
every rendered set of documentation (things like the fonts, CSS, and JavaScript
that live in <code>html/static/</code>), creating the search index, and printing out the
source code rendering, before beginning the process of rendering all the
documentation for the crate.</p>
<p>Several functions implemented directly on <code>Context</code> take the <code>clean::Crate</code> and
set up some state between rendering items or recursing on a module's child
items. From here the &quot;page rendering&quot; begins, via an enormous <code>write!()</code> call
in <code>html/layout.rs</code>. The parts that actually generate HTML from the items and
documentation occurs within a series of <code>std::fmt::Display</code> implementations and
functions that pass around a <code>&amp;mut std::fmt::Formatter</code>. The top-level
implementation that writes out the page body is the <code>impl&lt;'a&gt; fmt::Display for Item&lt;'a&gt;</code> in <code>html/render.rs</code>, which switches out to one of several <code>item_*</code>
functions based on the kind of <code>Item</code> being rendered.</p>
<p>Depending on what kind of rendering code you're looking for, you'll probably
find it either in <code>html/render.rs</code> for major items like &quot;what sections should I
print for a struct page&quot; or <code>html/format.rs</code> for smaller component pieces like
&quot;how should I print a where clause as part of some other item&quot;.</p>
<p>Whenever rustdoc comes across an item that should print hand-written
documentation alongside, it calls out to <code>html/markdown.rs</code> which interfaces
with the Markdown parser. This is exposed as a series of types that wrap a
string of Markdown, and implement <code>fmt::Display</code> to emit HTML text. It takes
special care to enable certain features like footnotes and tables and add
syntax highlighting to Rust code blocks (via <code>html/highlight.rs</code>) before
running the Markdown parser. There's also a function in here
(<code>find_testable_code</code>) that specifically scans for Rust code blocks so the
test-runner code can find all the doctests in the crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="#from-soup-to-nuts" id="from-soup-to-nuts"><h3>From soup to nuts</h3></a>
<p>(alternate title: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOLAGYmUQV0">&quot;An unbroken thread that stretches from those first <code>Cell</code>s
to us&quot;</a>)</p>
<p>It's important to note that the AST cleaning can ask the compiler for
information (crucially, <code>DocContext</code> contains a <code>TyCtxt</code>), but page rendering
cannot. The <code>clean::Crate</code> created within <code>run_core</code> is passed outside the
compiler context before being handed to <code>html::render::run</code>. This means that a
lot of the &quot;supplementary data&quot; that isn't immediately available inside an
item's definition, like which trait is the <code>Deref</code> trait used by the language,
needs to be collected during cleaning, stored in the <code>DocContext</code>, and passed
along to the <code>SharedContext</code> during HTML rendering.  This manifests as a bunch
of shared state, context variables, and <code>RefCell</code>s.</p>
<p>Also of note is that some items that come from &quot;asking the compiler&quot; don't go
directly into the <code>DocContext</code> - for example, when loading items from a foreign
crate, rustdoc will ask about trait implementations and generate new <code>Item</code>s
for the impls based on that information. This goes directly into the returned
<code>Crate</code> rather than roundabout through the <code>DocContext</code>. This way, these
implementations can be collected alongside the others, right before rendering
the HTML.</p>
<a class="header" href="#other-tricks-up-its-sleeve" id="other-tricks-up-its-sleeve"><h2>Other tricks up its sleeve</h2></a>
<p>All this describes the process for generating HTML documentation from a Rust
crate, but there are couple other major modes that rustdoc runs in. It can also
be run on a standalone Markdown file, or it can run doctests on Rust code or
standalone Markdown files. For the former, it shortcuts straight to
<code>html/markdown.rs</code>, optionally including a mode which inserts a Table of
Contents to the output HTML.</p>
<p>For the latter, rustdoc runs a similar partial-compilation to get relevant
documentation in <code>test.rs</code>, but instead of going through the full clean and
render process, it runs a much simpler crate walk to grab <em>just</em> the
hand-written documentation. Combined with the aforementioned
&quot;<code>find_testable_code</code>&quot; in <code>html/markdown.rs</code>, it builds up a collection of
tests to run before handing them off to the libtest test runner. One notable
location in <code>test.rs</code> is the function <code>make_test</code>, which is where hand-written
doctests get transformed into something that can be executed.</p>
<p>Some extra reading about <code>make_test</code> can be found
<a href="https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/02/23/how-the-doctests-get-made/">here</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#dotting-is-and-crossing-ts" id="dotting-is-and-crossing-ts"><h2>Dotting i's and crossing t's</h2></a>
<p>So that's rustdoc's code in a nutshell, but there's more things in the repo
that deal with it. Since we have the full <code>compiletest</code> suite at hand, there's
a set of tests in <code>src/test/rustdoc</code> that make sure the final HTML is what we
expect in various situations. These tests also use a supplementary script,
<code>src/etc/htmldocck.py</code>, that allows it to look through the final HTML using
XPath notation to get a precise look at the output. The full description of all
the commands available to rustdoc tests is in <code>htmldocck.py</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, there are separate tests for the search index and rustdoc's
ability to query it. The files in <code>src/test/rustdoc-js</code> each contain a
different search query and the expected results, broken out by search tab.
These files are processed by a script in <code>src/tools/rustdoc-js</code> and the Node.js
runtime. These tests don't have as thorough of a writeup, but a broad example
that features results in all tabs can be found in <code>basic.js</code>. The basic idea is
that you match a given <code>QUERY</code> with a set of <code>EXPECTED</code> results, complete with
the full item path of each item.</p>
<a class="header" href="#queries-demand-driven-compilation" id="queries-demand-driven-compilation"><h1>Queries: demand-driven compilation</h1></a>
<p>As described in <a href="high-level-overview.html">the high-level overview of the compiler</a>, the
Rust compiler is current transitioning from a traditional &quot;pass-based&quot;
setup to a &quot;demand-driven&quot; system. <strong>The Compiler Query System is the
key to our new demand-driven organization.</strong> The idea is pretty
simple. You have various queries that compute things about the input
– for example, there is a query called <code>type_of(def_id)</code> that, given
the def-id of some item, will compute the type of that item and return
it to you.</p>
<p>Query execution is <strong>memoized</strong> – so the first time you invoke a
query, it will go do the computation, but the next time, the result is
returned from a hashtable. Moreover, query execution fits nicely into
<strong>incremental computation</strong>; the idea is roughly that, when you do a
query, the result <strong>may</strong> be returned to you by loading stored data
from disk (but that's a separate topic we won't discuss further here).</p>
<p>The overall vision is that, eventually, the entire compiler
control-flow will be query driven. There will effectively be one
top-level query (&quot;compile&quot;) that will run compilation on a crate; this
will in turn demand information about that crate, starting from the
<em>end</em>.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>This &quot;compile&quot; query might demand to get a list of codegen-units
(i.e. modules that need to be compiled by LLVM).</li>
<li>But computing the list of codegen-units would invoke some subquery
that returns the list of all modules defined in the Rust source.</li>
<li>That query in turn would invoke something asking for the HIR.</li>
<li>This keeps going further and further back until we wind up doing the
actual parsing.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, that vision is not fully realized. Still, big chunks of the
compiler (for example, generating MIR) work exactly like this.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-query-evaluation-model-in-detail" id="the-query-evaluation-model-in-detail"><h3>The Query Evaluation Model in Detail</h3></a>
<p>The <a href="queries/query-evaluation-model-in-detail.html">Query Evaluation Model in Detail</a> chapter gives a more
in-depth description of what queries are and how they work.
If you intend to write a query of your own, this is a good read.</p>
<a class="header" href="#invoking-queries" id="invoking-queries"><h3>Invoking queries</h3></a>
<p>To invoke a query is simple. The tcx (&quot;type context&quot;) offers a method
for each defined query. So, for example, to invoke the <code>type_of</code>
query, you would just do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let ty = tcx.type_of(some_def_id);
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#how-the-compiler-executes-a-query" id="how-the-compiler-executes-a-query"><h3>How the compiler executes a query</h3></a>
<p>So you may be wondering what happens when you invoke a query
method. The answer is that, for each query, the compiler maintains a
cache – if your query has already been executed, then, the answer is
simple: we clone the return value out of the cache and return it
(therefore, you should try to ensure that the return types of queries
are cheaply cloneable; insert a <code>Rc</code> if necessary).</p>
<a class="header" href="#providers" id="providers"><h4>Providers</h4></a>
<p>If, however, the query is <em>not</em> in the cache, then the compiler will
try to find a suitable <strong>provider</strong>. A provider is a function that has
been defined and linked into the compiler somewhere that contains the
code to compute the result of the query.</p>
<p><strong>Providers are defined per-crate.</strong> The compiler maintains,
internally, a table of providers for every crate, at least
conceptually. Right now, there are really two sets: the providers for
queries about the <strong>local crate</strong> (that is, the one being compiled)
and providers for queries about <strong>external crates</strong> (that is,
dependencies of the local crate). Note that what determines the crate
that a query is targeting is not the <em>kind</em> of query, but the <em>key</em>.
For example, when you invoke <code>tcx.type_of(def_id)</code>, that could be a
local query or an external query, depending on what crate the <code>def_id</code>
is referring to (see the <code>self::keys::Key</code> trait for more information
on how that works).</p>
<p>Providers always have the same signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn provider&lt;'cx, 'tcx&gt;(tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'cx, 'tcx, 'tcx&gt;,
                       key: QUERY_KEY)
                       -&gt; QUERY_RESULT
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Providers take two arguments: the <code>tcx</code> and the query key. Note also
that they take the <em>global</em> tcx (i.e. they use the <code>'tcx</code> lifetime
twice), rather than taking a tcx with some active inference context.
They return the result of the query.</p>
<a class="header" href="#how-providers-are-setup" id="how-providers-are-setup"><h4>How providers are setup</h4></a>
<p>When the tcx is created, it is given the providers by its creator using
the <code>Providers</code> struct. This struct is generated by the macros here, but it
is basically a big list of function pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Providers {
    type_of: for&lt;'cx, 'tcx&gt; fn(TyCtxt&lt;'cx, 'tcx, 'tcx&gt;, DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>At present, we have one copy of the struct for local crates, and one
for external crates, though the plan is that we may eventually have
one per crate.</p>
<p>These <code>Provider</code> structs are ultimately created and populated by
<code>librustc_driver</code>, but it does this by distributing the work
throughout the other <code>rustc_*</code> crates. This is done by invoking
various <code>provide</code> functions. These functions tend to look something
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn provide(providers: &amp;mut Providers) {
    *providers = Providers {
        type_of,
        ..*providers
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is, they take an <code>&amp;mut Providers</code> and mutate it in place. Usually
we use the formulation above just because it looks nice, but you could
as well do <code>providers.type_of = type_of</code>, which would be equivalent.
(Here, <code>type_of</code> would be a top-level function, defined as we saw
before.) So, if we want to add a provider for some other query,
let's call it <code>fubar</code>, into the crate above, we might modify the <code>provide()</code>
function like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn provide(providers: &amp;mut Providers) {
    *providers = Providers {
        type_of,
        fubar,
        ..*providers
    };
}

fn fubar&lt;'cx, 'tcx&gt;(tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'cx, 'tcx&gt;, key: DefId) -&gt; Fubar&lt;'tcx&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>N.B. Most of the <code>rustc_*</code> crates only provide <strong>local
providers</strong>. Almost all <strong>extern providers</strong> wind up going through the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_metadata"><code>rustc_metadata</code> crate</a>, which loads the information from the
crate metadata. But in some cases there are crates that provide queries for
<em>both</em> local and external crates, in which case they define both a
<code>provide</code> and a <code>provide_extern</code> function that <code>rustc_driver</code> can
invoke.</p>
<a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-kind-of-query" id="adding-a-new-kind-of-query"><h3>Adding a new kind of query</h3></a>
<p>So suppose you want to add a new kind of query, how do you do so?
Well, defining a query takes place in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>first, you have to specify the query name and arguments; and then,</li>
<li>you have to supply query providers where needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To specify the query name and arguments, you simply add an entry to
the big macro invocation in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/query/index.html"><code>src/librustc/query/mod.rs</code></a>, which looks something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">rustc_queries! {
    Other {
        /// Records the type of every item.
        query type_of(key: DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; {
            cache { key.is_local() }
        }
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Queries are grouped into categories (<code>Other</code>, <code>Codegen</code>, <code>TypeChecking</code>, etc.).
Each group contains one or more queries. Each query definition is broken up like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">query type_of(key: DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; { ... }
^^    ^^^^^^^      ^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^   ^^^
|     |            |         |          |
|     |            |         |          query modifiers
|     |            |         result type of query
|     |            query key type
|     name of query
query keyword
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go over them one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query keyword:</strong> indicates a start of a query definition.</li>
<li><strong>Name of query:</strong> the name of the query method
(<code>tcx.type_of(..)</code>). Also used as the name of a struct
(<code>ty::queries::type_of</code>) that will be generated to represent
this query.</li>
<li><strong>Query key type:</strong> the type of the argument to this query.
This type must implement the <code>ty::query::keys::Key</code> trait, which
defines (for example) how to map it to a crate, and so forth.</li>
<li><strong>Result type of query:</strong> the type produced by this query. This type
should (a) not use <code>RefCell</code> or other interior mutability and (b) be
cheaply cloneable. Interning or using <code>Rc</code> or <code>Arc</code> is recommended for
non-trivial data types.
<ul>
<li>The one exception to those rules is the <code>ty::steal::Steal</code> type,
which is used to cheaply modify MIR in place. See the definition
of <code>Steal</code> for more details. New uses of <code>Steal</code> should <strong>not</strong> be
added without alerting <code>@rust-lang/compiler</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Query modifiers:</strong> various flags and options that customize how the
query is processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to add a query:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an entry to <code>rustc_queries!</code> using the format above.</li>
<li>Link the provider by modifying the appropriate <code>provide</code> method;
or add a new one if needed and ensure that <code>rustc_driver</code> is invoking it.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#query-structs-and-descriptions" id="query-structs-and-descriptions"><h4>Query structs and descriptions</h4></a>
<p>For each kind, the <code>rustc_queries</code> macro will generate a &quot;query struct&quot;
named after the query. This struct is a kind of a place-holder
describing the query. Each such struct implements the
<code>self::config::QueryConfig</code> trait, which has associated types for the
key/value of that particular query. Basically the code generated looks something
like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Dummy struct representing a particular kind of query:
pub struct type_of&lt;'tcx&gt; { data: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'tcx ()&gt; }

impl&lt;'tcx&gt; QueryConfig for type_of&lt;'tcx&gt; {
  type Key = DefId;
  type Value = Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;;

  const NAME: QueryName = QueryName::type_of;
  const CATEGORY: ProfileCategory = ProfileCategory::Other;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is an additional trait that you may wish to implement called
<code>self::config::QueryDescription</code>. This trait is used during cycle
errors to give a &quot;human readable&quot; name for the query, so that we can
summarize what was happening when the cycle occurred. Implementing
this trait is optional if the query key is <code>DefId</code>, but if you <em>don't</em>
implement it, you get a pretty generic error (&quot;processing <code>foo</code>...&quot;).
You can put new impls into the <code>config</code> module. They look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'tcx&gt; QueryDescription for queries::type_of&lt;'tcx&gt; {
    fn describe(tcx: TyCtxt, key: DefId) -&gt; String {
        format!(&quot;computing the type of `{}`&quot;, tcx.def_path_str(key))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another option is to add <code>desc</code> modifier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">rustc_queries! {
    Other {
        /// Records the type of every item.
        query type_of(key: DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; {
            desc { |tcx| &quot;computing the type of `{}`&quot;, tcx.def_path_str(key) }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>rustc_queries</code> macro will generate an appropriate <code>impl</code> automatically.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-query-evaluation-model-in-detail-1" id="the-query-evaluation-model-in-detail-1"><h1>The Query Evaluation Model in Detail</h1></a>
<p>This chapter provides a deeper dive into the abstract model queries are built on.
It does not go into implementation details but tries to explain
the underlying logic. The examples here, therefore, have been stripped down and
simplified and don't directly reflect the compilers internal APIs.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-a-query" id="what-is-a-query"><h2>What is a query?</h2></a>
<p>Abstractly we view the compiler's knowledge about a given crate as a &quot;database&quot;
and queries are the way of asking the compiler questions about it, i.e.
we &quot;query&quot; the compiler's &quot;database&quot; for facts.</p>
<p>However, there's something special to this compiler database: It starts out empty
and is filled on-demand when queries are executed. Consequently, a query must
know how to compute its result if the database does not contain it yet. For
doing so, it can access other queries and certain input values that the database
is pre-filled with on creation.</p>
<p>A query thus consists of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name that identifies the query</li>
<li>A &quot;key&quot; that specifies what we want to look up</li>
<li>A result type that specifies what kind of result it yields</li>
<li>A &quot;provider&quot; which is a function that specifies how the result is to be
computed if it isn't already present in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the name of the <code>type_of</code> query is <code>type_of</code>, its query key is a
<code>DefId</code> identifying the item we want to know the type of, the result type is
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, and the provider is a function that, given the query key and access
to the rest of the database, can compute the type of the item identified by the
key.</p>
<p>So in some sense a query is just a function that maps the query key to the
corresponding result. However, we have to apply some restrictions in order for
this to be sound:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key and result must be immutable values.</li>
<li>The provider function must be a pure function, that is, for the same key it
must always yield the same result.</li>
<li>The only parameters a provider function takes are the key and a reference to
the &quot;query context&quot; (which provides access to rest of the &quot;database&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The database is built up lazily by invoking queries. The query providers will
invoke other queries, for which the result is either already cached or computed
by calling another query provider. These query provider invocations
conceptually form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) at the leaves of which are
input values that are already known when the query context is created.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cachingmemoization" id="cachingmemoization"><h2>Caching/Memoization</h2></a>
<p>Results of query invocations are &quot;memoized&quot; which means that the query context
will cache the result in an internal table and, when the query is invoked with
the same query key again, will return the result from the cache instead of
running the provider again.</p>
<p>This caching is crucial for making the query engine efficient. Without
memoization the system would still be sound (that is, it would yield the same
results) but the same computations would be done over and over again.</p>
<p>Memoization is one of the main reasons why query providers have to be pure
functions. If calling a provider function could yield different results for
each invocation (because it accesses some global mutable state) then we could
not memoize the result.</p>
<a class="header" href="#input-data" id="input-data"><h2>Input data</h2></a>
<p>When the query context is created, it is still empty: No queries have been
executed, no results are cached. But the context already provides access to
&quot;input&quot; data, i.e. pieces of immutable data that where computed before the
context was created and that queries can access to do their computations.
Currently this input data consists mainly of the HIR map and the command-line
options the compiler was invoked with. In the future, inputs will just consist
of command-line options and a list of source files -- the HIR map will itself
be provided by a query which processes these source files.</p>
<p>Without inputs, queries would live in a void without anything to compute their
result from (remember, query providers only have access to other queries and
the context but not any other outside state or information).</p>
<p>For a query provider, input data and results of other queries look exactly the
same: It just tells the context &quot;give me the value of X&quot;. Because input data
is immutable, the provider can rely on it being the same across
different query invocations, just as is the case for query results.</p>
<a class="header" href="#an-example-execution-trace-of-some-queries" id="an-example-execution-trace-of-some-queries"><h2>An example execution trace of some queries</h2></a>
<p>How does this DAG of query invocations come into existence? At some point
the compiler driver will create the, as yet empty, query context. It will then,
from outside of the query system, invoke the queries it needs to perform its
task. This looks something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn compile_crate() {
    let cli_options = ...;
    let hir_map = ...;

    // Create the query context `tcx`
    let tcx = TyCtxt::new(cli_options, hir_map);

    // Do type checking by invoking the type check query
    tcx.type_check_crate();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>type_check_crate</code> query provider would look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn type_check_crate_provider(tcx, _key: ()) {
    let list_of_items = tcx.hir_map.list_of_items();

    for item_def_id in list_of_hir_items {
        tcx.type_check_item(item_def_id);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the <code>type_check_crate</code> query accesses input data
(<code>tcx.hir_map.list_of_items()</code>) and invokes other queries
(<code>type_check_item</code>). The <code>type_check_item</code>
invocations will themselves access input data and/or invoke other queries,
so that in the end the DAG of query invocations will be built up backwards
from the node that was initially executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">         (2)                                                 (1)

// (x) denotes invocation order
</code></pre>
<p>We also see that often a query result can be read from the cache:
<code>type_of(bar)</code> was computed for <code>type_check_item(foo)</code> so when
<code>type_check_item(bar)</code> needs it, it is already in the cache.</p>
<p>Query results stay cached in the query context as long as the context lives.
So if the compiler driver invoked another query later on, the above graph
would still exist and already executed queries would not have to be re-done.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cycles" id="cycles"><h2>Cycles</h2></a>
<p>Earlier we stated that query invocations form a DAG. However, it would be easy
form a cyclic graph by, for example, having a query provider like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn cyclic_query_provider(tcx, key) -&gt; u32 {
  // Invoke the same query with the same key again
  tcx.cyclic_query(key)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since query providers are regular functions, this would behave much as expected:
Evaluation would get stuck in an infinite recursion. A query like this would not
be very useful either. However, sometimes certain kinds of invalid user input
can result in queries being called in a cyclic way. The query engine includes
a check for cyclic invocations and, because cycles are an irrecoverable error,
will abort execution with a &quot;cycle error&quot; messages that tries to be human
readable.</p>
<p>At some point the compiler had a notion of &quot;cycle recovery&quot;, that is, one could
&quot;try&quot; to execute a query and if it ended up causing a cycle, proceed in some
other fashion. However, this was later removed because it is not entirely
clear what the theoretical consequences of this are, especially regarding
incremental compilation.</p>
<a class="header" href="#steal-queries" id="steal-queries"><h2>&quot;Steal&quot; Queries</h2></a>
<p>Some queries have their result wrapped in a <code>Steal&lt;T&gt;</code> struct. These queries
behave exactly the same as regular with one exception: Their result is expected
to be &quot;stolen&quot; out of the cache at some point, meaning some other part of the
program is taking ownership of it and the result cannot be accessed anymore.</p>
<p>This stealing mechanism exists purely as a performance optimization because some
result values are too costly to clone (e.g. the MIR of a function). It seems
like result stealing would violate the condition that query results must be
immutable (after all we are moving the result value out of the cache) but it is
OK as long as the mutation is not observable. This is achieved by two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before a result is stolen, we make sure to eagerly run all queries that
might ever need to read that result. This has to be done manually by calling
those queries.</li>
<li>Whenever a query tries to access a stolen result, we make the compiler ICE so
that such a condition cannot go unnoticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an ideal setup because of the manual intervention needed, so it
should be used sparingly and only when it is well known which queries might
access a given result. In practice, however, stealing has not turned out to be
much of a maintainance burden.</p>
<p>To summarize: &quot;Steal queries&quot; break some of the rules in a controlled way.
There are checks in place that make sure that nothing can go silently wrong.</p>
<a class="header" href="#parallel-query-execution" id="parallel-query-execution"><h2>Parallel Query Execution</h2></a>
<p>The query model has some properties that make it actually feasible to evaluate
multiple queries in parallel without too much of an effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>All data a query provider can access is accessed via the query context, so
the query context can take care of synchronizing access.</li>
<li>Query results are required to be immutable so they can safely be used by
different threads concurrently.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nightly compiler already implements parallel query evaluation as follows:</p>
<p>When a query <code>foo</code> is evaluated, the cache table for <code>foo</code> is locked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there already is a result, we can clone it,release the lock and
we are done.</li>
<li>If there is no cache entry and no other active query invocation computing the
same result, we mark the key as being &quot;in progress&quot;, release the lock and
start evaluating.</li>
<li>If there <em>is</em> another query invocation for the same key in progress, we
release the lock, and just block the thread until the other invocation has
computed the result we are waiting for. This cannot deadlock because, as
mentioned before, query invocations form a DAG. Some thread will always make
progress.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#incremental-compilation" id="incremental-compilation"><h1>Incremental compilation</h1></a>
<p>The incremental compilation scheme is, in essence, a surprisingly
simple extension to the overall query system. We'll start by describing
a slightly simplified variant of the real thing – the &quot;basic algorithm&quot; –
and then describe some possible improvements.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-basic-algorithm" id="the-basic-algorithm"><h2>The basic algorithm</h2></a>
<p>The basic algorithm is
called the <strong>red-green</strong> algorithm<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#salsa">1</a></sup>. The high-level idea is
that, after each run of the compiler, we will save the results of all
the queries that we do, as well as the <strong>query DAG</strong>. The
<strong>query DAG</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> that indexes which queries executed which
other queries. So, for example, there would be an edge from a query Q1
to another query Q2 if computing Q1 required computing Q2 (note that
because queries cannot depend on themselves, this results in a DAG and
not a general graph).</p>
<p>On the next run of the compiler, then, we can sometimes reuse these
query results to avoid re-executing a query. We do this by assigning
every query a <strong>color</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a query is colored <strong>red</strong>, that means that its result during
this compilation has <strong>changed</strong> from the previous compilation.</li>
<li>If a query is colored <strong>green</strong>, that means that its result is
the <strong>same</strong> as the previous compilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two key insights here:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if all the inputs to query Q are colored green, then the
query Q <strong>must</strong> result in the same value as last time and hence
need not be re-executed (or else the compiler is not deterministic).</li>
<li>Second, even if some inputs to a query changes, it may be that it
<strong>still</strong> produces the same result as the previous compilation. In
particular, the query may only use part of its input.
<ul>
<li>Therefore, after executing a query, we always check whether it
produced the same result as the previous time. <strong>If it did,</strong> we
can still mark the query as green, and hence avoid re-executing
dependent queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#the-try-mark-green-algorithm" id="the-try-mark-green-algorithm"><h3>The try-mark-green algorithm</h3></a>
<p>At the core of incremental compilation is an algorithm called
&quot;try-mark-green&quot;. It has the job of determining the color of a given
query Q (which must not have yet been executed). In cases where Q has
red inputs, determining Q's color may involve re-executing Q so that
we can compare its output, but if all of Q's inputs are green, then we
can conclude that Q must be green without re-executing it or inspecting
its value at all. In the compiler, this allows us to avoid
deserializing the result from disk when we don't need it, and in fact
enables us to sometimes skip <em>serializing</em> the result as well
(see the refinements section below).</p>
<p>Try-mark-green works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the query Q was executed during the previous compilation.
<ul>
<li>If not, we can just re-execute the query as normal, and assign it the
color of red.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If yes, then load the 'dependent queries' of Q.</li>
<li>If there is a saved result, then we load the <code>reads(Q)</code> vector from the
query DAG. The &quot;reads&quot; is the set of queries that Q executed during
its execution.
<ul>
<li>For each query R in <code>reads(Q)</code>, we recursively demand the color
of R using try-mark-green.
<ul>
<li>Note: it is important that we visit each node in <code>reads(Q)</code> in same order
as they occurred in the original compilation. See <a href="#dag">the section on the
query DAG below</a>.</li>
<li>If <strong>any</strong> of the nodes in <code>reads(Q)</code> wind up colored <strong>red</strong>, then Q is
dirty.
<ul>
<li>We re-execute Q and compare the hash of its result to the hash of the
result from the previous compilation.</li>
<li>If the hash has not changed, we can mark Q as <strong>green</strong> and return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, <strong>all</strong> of the nodes in <code>reads(Q)</code> must be <strong>green</strong>. In that
case, we can color Q as <strong>green</strong> and return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="dag"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#the-query-dag" id="the-query-dag"><h3>The query DAG</h3></a>
<p>The query DAG code is stored in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc/dep_graph"><code>src/librustc/dep_graph</code></a>. Construction of the DAG is done
by instrumenting the query execution.</p>
<p>One key point is that the query DAG also tracks ordering; that is, for
each query Q, we not only track the queries that Q reads, we track the
<strong>order</strong> in which they were read.  This allows try-mark-green to walk
those queries back in the same order. This is important because once a
subquery comes back as red, we can no longer be sure that Q will continue
along the same path as before. That is, imagine a query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main_query(tcx) {
    if tcx.subquery1() {
        tcx.subquery2()
    } else {
        tcx.subquery3()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine that in the first compilation, <code>main_query</code> starts by
executing <code>subquery1</code>, and this returns true. In that case, the next
query <code>main_query</code> executes will be <code>subquery2</code>, and <code>subquery3</code> will
not be executed at all.</p>
<p>But now imagine that in the <strong>next</strong> compilation, the input has
changed such that <code>subquery1</code> returns <strong>false</strong>. In this case, <code>subquery2</code>
would never execute. If try-mark-green were to visit <code>reads(main_query)</code> out
of order, however, it might visit <code>subquery2</code> before <code>subquery1</code>, and hence
execute it.
This can lead to ICEs and other problems in the compiler.</p>
<a class="header" href="#improvements-to-the-basic-algorithm" id="improvements-to-the-basic-algorithm"><h2>Improvements to the basic algorithm</h2></a>
<p>In the description of the basic algorithm, we said that at the end of
compilation we would save the results of all the queries that were
performed.  In practice, this can be quite wasteful – many of those
results are very cheap to recompute, and serializing and deserializing
them is not a particular win. In practice, what we would do is to save
<strong>the hashes</strong> of all the subqueries that we performed. Then, in select cases,
we <strong>also</strong> save the results.</p>
<p>This is why the incremental algorithm separates computing the
<strong>color</strong> of a node, which often does not require its value, from
computing the <strong>result</strong> of a node. Computing the result is done via a simple
algorithm like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if a saved result for Q is available. If so, compute the color of Q.
If Q is green, deserialize and return the saved result.</li>
<li>Otherwise, execute Q.
<ul>
<li>We can then compare the hash of the result and color Q as green if
it did not change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The incremental compilation scheme is, in essence, a surprisingly

<ol>
<li>queries are pure functions -- given the same inputs, a query will always
yield the same result, and</li>

</ol>
<p>This chapter will explain how we can use these properties for making things

<a class="header" href="#a-basic-algorithm-for-incremental-query-evaluation" id="a-basic-algorithm-for-incremental-query-evaluation"><h1>A Basic Algorithm For Incremental Query Evaluation</h1></a>
<p>As explained in the <a href="./query-evaluation-model-in-detail.html">query evaluation model primer</a>, query
invocations form a directed-acyclic graph. Here's the example from the
previous chapter again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">  list_of_all_hir_items &lt;----------------------------- type_check_crate()

  Hir(foo) &lt;--- type_of(foo) &lt;--- type_check_item(foo) &lt;-------+
                                      |                        |
                    +-----------------+                        |
                    |                                          |
                    v                                          |
  Hir(bar) &lt;--- type_of(bar) &lt;--- type_check_item(bar) &lt;-------+
</code></pre>
<p>Since every access from one query to another has to go through the query
context, we can record these accesses and thus actually build this dependency
graph in memory. With dependency tracking enabled, when compilation is done,
we know which queries were invoked (the nodes of the graph) and for each
invocation, which other queries or input has gone into computing the query's
result (the edges of the graph).</p>
<p>Now suppose, we change the source code of our program so that
HIR of <code>bar</code> looks different than before. Our goal is to only recompute
those queries that are actually affected by the change while just re-using
the cached results of all the other queries. Given the dependency graph we can
do exactly that. For a given query invocation, the graph tells us exactly
what data has gone into computing its results, we just have to follow the
edges until we reach something that has changed. If we don't encounter
anything that has changed, we know that the query still would evaluate to
the same result we already have in our cache.</p>
<p>Taking the <code>type_of(foo)</code> invocation from above as example, we can check
whether the cached result is still valid by following the edges to its
inputs. The only edge leads to <code>Hir(foo)</code>, an input that has not been affected
by the change. So we know that the cached result for <code>type_of(foo)</code> is still
valid.</p>
<p>The story is a bit different for <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>: We again walk the
edges and already know that <code>type_of(foo)</code> is fine. Then we get to
<code>type_of(bar)</code> which we have not checked yet, so we walk the edges of
<code>type_of(bar)</code> and encounter <code>Hir(bar)</code> which <em>has</em> changed. Consequently
the result of <code>type_of(bar)</code> might yield a different same result than what we
have in the cache and, transitively, the result of <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>
might have changed too. We thus re-run <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>, which in
turn will re-run <code>type_of(bar)</code>, which will yield an up-to-date result
because it reads the up-to-date version of <code>Hir(bar)</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-problem-with-the-basic-algorithm-false-positives" id="the-problem-with-the-basic-algorithm-false-positives"><h1>The Problem With The Basic Algorithm: False Positives</h1></a>
<p>If you read the previous paragraph carefully, you'll notice that it says that
<code>type_of(bar)</code> <em>might</em> have changed because one of its inputs has changed.
There's also the possibility that it might still yield exactly the same
result <em>even though</em> its input has changed. Consider an example with a
simple query that just computes the sign of an integer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">  IntValue(x) &lt;---- sign_of(x) &lt;--- some_other_query(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say that <code>IntValue(x)</code> starts out as <code>1000</code> and then is set to <code>2000</code>.
Even though <code>IntValue(x)</code> is different in the two cases, <code>sign_of(x)</code> yields
the result <code>+</code> in both cases.</p>
<p>If we follow the basic algorithm, however, <code>some_other_query(x)</code> would have to
(unnecessarily) be re-evaluated because it transitively depends on a changed
input. Change detection yields a &quot;false positive&quot; in this case because it has
to conservatively assume that <code>some_other_query(x)</code> might be affected by that
changed input.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it turns out that the actual queries in the compiler are full
of examples like this and small changes to the input often potentially affect
very large parts of the output binaries. As a consequence, we had to make the
change detection system smarter and more accurate.</p>
<a class="header" href="#improving-accuracy-the-red-green-algorithm" id="improving-accuracy-the-red-green-algorithm"><h1>Improving Accuracy: The red-green Algorithm</h1></a>
<p>The &quot;false positives&quot; problem can be solved by interleaving change detection
and query re-evaluation. Instead of walking the graph all the way to the
inputs when trying to find out if some cached result is still valid, we can
check if a result has <em>actually</em> changed after we were forced to re-evaluate
it.</p>
<p>We call this algorithm, for better or worse, the red-green algorithm because nodes
in the dependency graph are assigned the color green if we were able to prove
that its cached result is still valid and the color red if the result has
turned out to be different after re-evaluating it.</p>
<p>The meat of red-green change tracking is implemented in the try-mark-green
algorithm, that, you've guessed it, tries to mark a given node as green:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn try_mark_green(tcx, current_node) -&gt; bool {

    // Fetch the inputs to `current_node`, i.e. get the nodes that the direct
    // edges from `node` lead to.
    let dependencies = tcx.dep_graph.get_dependencies_of(current_node);

    // Now check all the inputs for changes
    for dependency in dependencies {

        match tcx.dep_graph.get_node_color(dependency) {

</code></pre>
<p>By using red-green marking we can avoid the devastating cumulative effect of
having false positives during change detection. Whenever a query is executed
in incremental mode, we first check if its already green. If not, we run
<code>try_mark_green()</code> on it. If it still isn't green after that, then we actually
invoke the query provider to re-compute the result.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-real-world-how-persistence-makes-everything-complicated" id="the-real-world-how-persistence-makes-everything-complicated"><h1>The Real World: How Persistence Makes Everything Complicated</h1></a>
<p>The sections above described the underlying algorithm for incremental
compilation but because the compiler process exits after being finished and
takes the query context with its result cache with it into oblivion, we have
persist data to disk, so the next compilation session can make use of it.
This comes with a whole new set of implementation challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query results cache is stored to disk, so they are not readily available
for change comparison.</li>
<li>A subsequent compilation session will start off with new version of the code
that has arbitrary changes applied to it. All kinds of IDs and indices that
are generated from a global, sequential counter (e.g. <code>NodeId</code>, <code>DefId</code>, etc)
might have shifted, making the persisted results on disk not immediately
usable anymore because the same numeric IDs and indices might refer to
completely new things in the new compilation session.</li>
<li>Persisting things to disk comes at a cost, so not every tiny piece of
information should be actually cached in between compilation sessions.
Fixed-sized, plain-old-data is preferred to complex things that need to run
branching code during (de-)serialization.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe how the compiler currently solves these issues.</p>

<p>As noted before, various IDs (like <code>DefId</code>) are generated by the compiler in a
way that depends on the contents of the source code being compiled. ID assignment
is usually deterministic, that is, if the exact same code is compiled twice,
the same things will end up with the same IDs. However, if something
changes, e.g. a function is added in the middle of a file, there is no
guarantee that anything will have the same ID as it had before.</p>
<p>As a consequence we cannot represent the data in our on-disk cache the same
way it is represented in memory. For example, if we just stored a piece
of type information like <code>TyKind::FnDef(DefId, &amp;'tcx Substs&lt;'tcx&gt;)</code> (as we do
in memory) and then the contained <code>DefId</code> points to a different function in
a new compilation session we'd be in trouble.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to find &quot;stable&quot; forms for IDs which remain
valid in between compilation sessions. For the most important case, <code>DefId</code>s,
these are the so-called <code>DefPath</code>s. Each <code>DefId</code> has a
corresponding <code>DefPath</code> but in place of a numeric ID, a <code>DefPath</code> is based on
the path to the identified item, e.g. <code>std::collections::HashMap</code>. The
advantage of an ID like this is that it is not affected by unrelated changes.
For example, one can add a new function to <code>std::collections</code> but
<code>std::collections::HashMap</code> would still be <code>std::collections::HashMap</code>. A
<code>DefPath</code> is &quot;stable&quot; across changes made to the source code while a <code>DefId</code>
isn't.</p>
<p>There is also the <code>DefPathHash</code> which is just a 128-bit hash value of the
<code>DefPath</code>. The two contain the same information and we mostly use the
<code>DefPathHash</code> because it simpler to handle, being <code>Copy</code> and self-contained.</p>
<p>This principle of stable identifiers is used to make the data in the on-disk
cache resilient to source code changes. Instead of storing a <code>DefId</code>, we store
the <code>DefPathHash</code> and when we deserialize something from the cache, we map the
<code>DefPathHash</code> to the corresponding <code>DefId</code> in the <em>current</em> compilation session
(which is just a simple hash table lookup).</p>
<p>The <code>HirId</code>, used for identifying HIR components that don't have their own
<code>DefId</code>, is another such stable ID. It is (conceptually) a pair of a <code>DefPath</code>
and a <code>LocalId</code>, where the <code>LocalId</code> identifies something (e.g. a <code>hir::Expr</code>)
locally within its &quot;owner&quot; (e.g. a <code>hir::Item</code>). If the owner is moved around,
the <code>LocalId</code>s within it are still the same.</p>
<a class="header" href="#checking-query-results-for-changes-stablehash-and-fingerprints" id="checking-query-results-for-changes-stablehash-and-fingerprints"><h2>Checking Query Results For Changes: StableHash And Fingerprints</h2></a>
<p>In order to do red-green-marking we often need to check if the result of a
query has changed compared to the result it had during the previous
compilation session. There are two performance problems with this though:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd like to avoid having to load the previous result from disk just for
doing the comparison. We already computed the new result and will use that.
Also loading a result from disk will &quot;pollute&quot; the interners with data that
is unlikely to ever be used.</li>
<li>We don't want to store each and every result in the on-disk cache. For
example, it would be wasted effort to persist things to disk that are
already available in upstream crates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler avoids these problems by using so-called <code>Fingerprint</code>s. Each time
a new query result is computed, the query engine will compute a 128 bit hash
value of the result. We call this hash value &quot;the <code>Fingerprint</code> of the query
result&quot;. The hashing is (and has to be) done &quot;in a stable way&quot;. This means
that whenever something is hashed that might change in between compilation
sessions (e.g. a <code>DefId</code>), we instead hash its stable equivalent
(e.g. the corresponding <code>DefPath</code>). That's what the whole <code>StableHash</code>
infrastructure is for. This way <code>Fingerprint</code>s computed in two
different compilation sessions are still comparable.</p>
<p>The next step is to store these fingerprints along with the dependency graph.
This is cheap since fingerprints are just bytes to be copied. It's also cheap to
load the entire set of fingerprints together with the dependency graph.</p>
<p>Now, when red-green-marking reaches the point where it needs to check if a
result has changed, it can just compare the (already loaded) previous
fingerprint to the fingerprint of the new result.</p>
<p>This approach works rather well but it's not without flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a small possibility of hash collisions. That is, two different
results could have the same fingerprint and the system would erroneously
assume that the result hasn't changed, leading to a missed update.</p>
<p>We mitigate this risk by using a high-quality hash function and a 128 bit
wide hash value. Due to these measures the practical risk of a hash
collision is negligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing fingerprints is quite costly. It is the main reason why incremental
compilation can be slower than non-incremental compilation. We are forced to
use a good and thus expensive hash function, and we have to map things to
their stable equivalents while doing the hashing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future we might want to explore different approaches to this problem.
For now it's <code>StableHash</code> and <code>Fingerprint</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#a-tale-of-two-depgraphs-the-old-and-the-new" id="a-tale-of-two-depgraphs-the-old-and-the-new"><h2>A Tale Of Two DepGraphs: The Old And The New</h2></a>
<p>The initial description of dependency tracking glosses over a few details
that quickly become a head scratcher when actually trying to implement things.
In particular it's easy to overlook that we are actually dealing with <em>two</em>
dependency graphs: The one we built during the previous compilation session and
the one that we are building for the current compilation session.</p>
<p>When a compilation session starts, the compiler loads the previous dependency
graph into memory as an immutable piece of data. Then, when a query is invoked,
it will first try to mark the corresponding node in the graph as green. This
means really that we are trying to mark the node in the <em>previous</em> dep-graph
as green that corresponds to the query key in the <em>current</em> session. How do we
do this mapping between current query key and previous <code>DepNode</code>? The answer
is again <code>Fingerprint</code>s: Nodes in the dependency graph are identified by a
fingerprint of the query key. Since fingerprints are stable across compilation
sessions, computing one in the current session allows us to find a node
in the dependency graph from the previous session. If we don't find a node with
the given fingerprint, it means that the query key refers to something that
did not yet exist in the previous session.</p>
<p>So, having found the dep-node in the previous dependency graph, we can look
up its dependencies (also dep-nodes in the previous graph) and continue with
the rest of the try-mark-green algorithm. The next interesting thing happens
when we successfully marked the node as green. At that point we copy the node
and the edges to its dependencies from the old graph into the new graph. We
have to do this because the new dep-graph cannot not acquire the
node and edges via the regular dependency tracking. The tracking system can
only record edges while actually running a query -- but running the query,
although we have the result already cached, is exactly what we want to avoid.</p>
<p>Once the compilation session has finished, all the unchanged parts have been
copied over from the old into the new dependency graph, while the changed parts
have been added to the new graph by the tracking system. At this point, the
new graph is serialized out to disk, alongside the query result cache, and can
act as the previous dep-graph in a subsequent compilation session.</p>

<a class="header" href="#testing-the-dependency-graph" id="testing-the-dependency-graph"><h2>Testing the dependency graph</h2></a>
<p>There are various ways to write tests against the dependency graph.
The simplest mechanisms are the <code>#[rustc_if_this_changed]</code> and
<code>#[rustc_then_this_would_need]</code> annotations. These are used in compile-fail
tests to test whether the expected set of paths exist in the dependency graph.
As an example, see <code>src/test/compile-fail/dep-graph-caller-callee.rs</code>.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can annotate a test like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[rustc_if_this_changed]
fn foo() { }

#[rustc_then_this_would_need(TypeckTables)] //~ ERROR OK
fn bar() { foo(); }

#[rustc_then_this_would_need(TypeckTables)] //~ ERROR no path
fn baz() { }
</code></pre>
<p>This will check whether there is a path in the dependency graph from <code>Hir(foo)</code>
to <code>TypeckTables(bar)</code>. An error is reported for each
<code>#[rustc_then_this_would_need]</code> annotation that indicates whether a path
exists. <code>//~ ERROR</code> annotations can then be used to test if a path is found (as
demonstrated above).</p>
<a class="header" href="#debugging-the-dependency-graph" id="debugging-the-dependency-graph"><h2>Debugging the dependency graph</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#dumping-the-graph" id="dumping-the-graph"><h3>Dumping the graph</h3></a>
<p>The compiler is also capable of dumping the dependency graph for your
debugging pleasure. To do so, pass the <code>-Z dump-dep-graph</code> flag. The
graph will be dumped to <code>dep_graph.{txt,dot}</code> in the current
directory.  You can override the filename with the <code>RUST_DEP_GRAPH</code>
environment variable.</p>
<p>Frequently, though, the full dep graph is quite overwhelming and not
particularly helpful. Therefore, the compiler also allows you to filter
the graph. You can filter in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>All edges originating in a particular set of nodes (usually a single node).</li>
<li>All edges reaching a particular set of nodes.</li>
<li>All edges that lie between given start and end nodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>To filter, use the <code>RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER</code> environment variable, which should
look like one of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">source_filter     // nodes originating from source_filter
-&gt; target_filter  // nodes that can reach target_filter
source_filter -&gt; target_filter // nodes in between source_filter and target_filter
</code></pre>
<p><code>source_filter</code> and <code>target_filter</code> are a <code>&amp;</code>-separated list of strings.
A node is considered to match a filter if all of those strings appear in its
label. So, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='-&gt; TypeckTables'
</code></pre>
<p>would select the predecessors of all <code>TypeckTables</code> nodes. Usually though you
want the <code>TypeckTables</code> node for some particular fn, so you might write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='-&gt; TypeckTables &amp; bar'
</code></pre>
<p>This will select only the predecessors of <code>TypeckTables</code> nodes for functions
with <code>bar</code> in their name.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are finding that when you change <code>foo</code> you need to re-type-check
<code>bar</code>, but you don't think you should have to. In that case, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='Hir &amp; foo -&gt; TypeckTables &amp; bar'
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump out all the nodes that lead from <code>Hir(foo)</code> to
<code>TypeckTables(bar)</code>, from which you can (hopefully) see the source
of the erroneous edge.</p>
<a class="header" href="#tracking-down-incorrect-edges" id="tracking-down-incorrect-edges"><h3>Tracking down incorrect edges</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes, after you dump the dependency graph, you will find some
path that should not exist, but you will not be quite sure how it came
to be. <strong>When the compiler is built with debug assertions,</strong> it can
help you track that down. Simply set the <code>RUST_FORBID_DEP_GRAPH_EDGE</code>
environment variable to a filter. Every edge created in the dep-graph
will be tested against that filter – if it matches, a <code>bug!</code> is
reported, so you can easily see the backtrace (<code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code>).</p>
<p>The syntax for these filters is the same as described in the previous
section. However, note that this filter is applied to every <strong>edge</strong>
and doesn't handle longer paths in the graph, unlike the previous
section.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>You find that there is a path from the <code>Hir</code> of <code>foo</code> to the type
check of <code>bar</code> and you don't think there should be. You dump the
dep-graph as described in the previous section and open <code>dep-graph.txt</code>
to see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Hir(foo) -&gt; Collect(bar)
Collect(bar) -&gt; TypeckTables(bar)
</code></pre>
<p>That first edge looks suspicious to you. So you set
<code>RUST_FORBID_DEP_GRAPH_EDGE</code> to <code>Hir&amp;foo -&gt; Collect&amp;bar</code>, re-run, and
then observe the backtrace. Voila, bug fixed!</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-parser" id="the-parser"><h1>The Parser</h1></a>
<p>The parser is responsible for converting raw Rust source code into a structured
form which is easier for the compiler to work with, usually called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract
Syntax Tree</em></a>. An AST mirrors the structure of a Rust program in memory,
using a <code>Span</code> to link a particular AST node back to its source text.</p>
<p>The bulk of the parser lives in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/index.html">libsyntax</a> crate.</p>
<p>Like most parsers, the parsing process is composed of two main steps,</p>
<ul>
<li>lexical analysis – turn a stream of characters into a stream of token trees</li>
<li>parsing – turn the token trees into an AST</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>syntax</code> crate contains several main players,</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html"><code>SourceMap</code></a> for mapping AST nodes to their source code</li>
<li>the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/index.html">ast module</a> contains types corresponding to each AST node</li>
<li>a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/lexer/struct.StringReader.html"><code>StringReader</code></a> for lexing source code into tokens</li>
<li>the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/index.html">parser module</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/parser/struct.Parser.html"><code>Parser</code></a> struct are in charge of actually parsing
tokens into AST nodes,</li>
<li>and a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/visit/index.html">visit module</a> for walking the AST and inspecting or mutating the AST
nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main entrypoint to the parser is via the various <code>parse_*</code> functions in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/index.html">parser module</a>. They let you do things like turn a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceFile.html"><code>SourceFile</code></a>
(e.g. the source in a single file) into a token stream, create a parser from
the token stream, and then execute the parser to get a <code>Crate</code> (the root AST
node).</p>
<p>To minimise the amount of copying that is done, both the <code>StringReader</code> and
<code>Parser</code> have lifetimes which bind them to the parent <code>ParseSess</code>. This contains
all the information needed while parsing, as well as the <code>SourceMap</code> itself.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-test-attribute" id="the-test-attribute"><h3>The <code>#[test]</code> attribute</h3></a>
<p>Today, rust programmers rely on a built in attribute called <code>#[test]</code>. All
you have to do is mark a function as a test and include some asserts like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
fn my_test() {
  assert!(2+2 == 4);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When this program is compiled using <code>rustc --test</code> or <code>cargo test</code>, it will
produce an executable that can run this, and any other test function. This
method of testing allows tests to live alongside code in an organic way. You
can even put tests inside private modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod my_priv_mod {
  fn my_priv_func() -&gt; bool {}

  #[test]
  fn test_priv_func() {
    assert!(my_priv_func());
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Private items can thus be easily tested without worrying about how to expose
the them to any sort of external testing apparatus. This is key to the
ergonomics of testing in Rust. Semantically, however, it's rather odd.
How does any sort of <code>main</code> function invoke these tests if they're not visible?
What exactly is <code>rustc --test</code> doing?</p>
<p><code>#[test]</code> is implemented as a syntactic transformation inside the compiler's
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/libsyntax"><code>libsyntax</code> crate</a>. Essentially, it's a fancy macro, that
rewrites the crate in 3 steps:</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-1-re-exporting" id="step-1-re-exporting"><h4>Step 1: Re-Exporting</h4></a>
<p>As mentioned earlier, tests can exist inside private modules, so we need a
way of exposing them to the main function, without breaking any existing
code. To that end, <code>libsyntax</code> will create local modules called
<code>__test_reexports</code> that recursively reexport tests. This expansion translates
the above example into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod my_priv_mod {
  fn my_priv_func() -&gt; bool {}

  pub fn test_priv_func() {
    assert!(my_priv_func());
  }

  pub mod __test_reexports {
    pub use super::test_priv_func;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, our test can be accessed as
<code>my_priv_mod::__test_reexports::test_priv_func</code>. For deeper module
structures, <code>__test_reexports</code> will reexport modules that contain tests, so a
test at <code>a::b::my_test</code> becomes
<code>a::__test_reexports::b::__test_reexports::my_test</code>. While this process seems
pretty safe, what happens if there is an existing <code>__test_reexports</code> module?
The answer: nothing.</p>
<p>To explain, we need to understand <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.Ident.html">how the AST represents
identifiers</a>. The name of every function, variable, module, etc. is
not stored as a string, but rather as an opaque <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.Ident.html">Symbol</a> which is
essentially an ID number for each identifier. The compiler keeps a separate
hashtable that allows us to recover the human-readable name of a Symbol when
necessary (such as when printing a syntax error). When the compiler generates
the <code>__test_reexports</code> module, it generates a new Symbol for the identifier,
so while the compiler-generated <code>__test_reexports</code> may share a name with your
hand-written one, it will not share a Symbol. This technique prevents name
collision during code generation and is the foundation of Rust's macro
hygiene.</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-2-harness-generation" id="step-2-harness-generation"><h4>Step 2: Harness Generation</h4></a>
<p>Now that our tests are accessible from the root of our crate, we need to do
something with them. <code>libsyntax</code> generates a module like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub mod __test {
  extern crate test;
  const TESTS: &amp;'static [self::test::TestDescAndFn] = &amp;[/*...*/];

  #[main]
  pub fn main() {
    self::test::test_static_main(TESTS);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>While this transformation is simple, it gives us a lot of insight into how
tests are actually run. The tests are aggregated into an array and passed to
a test runner called <code>test_static_main</code>. We'll come back to exactly what
<code>TestDescAndFn</code> is, but for now, the key takeaway is that there is a crate
called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/test/index.html"><code>test</code></a> that is part of Rust core, that implements all of the
runtime for testing. <code>test</code>'s interface is unstable, so the only stable way
to interact with it is through the <code>#[test]</code> macro.</p>
<a class="header" href="#step-3-test-object-generation" id="step-3-test-object-generation"><h4>Step 3: Test Object Generation</h4></a>
<p>If you've written tests in Rust before, you may be familiar with some of the
optional attributes available on test functions. For example, a test can be
annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code> if we expect the test to cause a panic. It
looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn foo() {
  panic!(&quot;intentional&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means our tests are more than just simple functions, they have
configuration information as well. <code>test</code> encodes this configuration data
into a struct called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/test/struct.TestDesc.html"><code>TestDesc</code></a>. For each test function in a
crate, <code>libsyntax</code> will parse its attributes and generate a <code>TestDesc</code>
instance. It then combines the <code>TestDesc</code> and test function into the
predictably named <code>TestDescAndFn</code> struct, that <code>test_static_main</code> operates
on. For a given test, the generated <code>TestDescAndFn</code> instance looks like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">self::test::TestDescAndFn{
  desc: self::test::TestDesc{
    name: self::test::StaticTestName(&quot;foo&quot;),
    ignore: false,
    should_panic: self::test::ShouldPanic::Yes,
    allow_fail: false,
  },
  testfn: self::test::StaticTestFn(||
    self::test::assert_test_result(::crate::__test_reexports::foo())),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once we've constructed an array of these test objects, they're passed to the
test runner via the harness generated in step 2.</p>
<a class="header" href="#inspecting-the-generated-code" id="inspecting-the-generated-code"><h3>Inspecting the generated code</h3></a>
<p>On nightly rust, there's an unstable flag called <code>unpretty</code> that you can use
to print out the module source after macro expansion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rustc my_mod.rs -Z unpretty=hir
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#macro-expansion" id="macro-expansion"><h1>Macro expansion</h1></a>
<p>Macro expansion happens during parsing. <code>rustc</code> has two parsers, in fact: the
normal Rust parser, and the macro parser. During the parsing phase, the normal
Rust parser will set aside the contents of macros and their invocations. Later,
before name resolution, macros are expanded using these portions of the code.
The macro parser, in turn, may call the normal Rust parser when it needs to
bind a metavariable (e.g.  <code>$my_expr</code>) while parsing the contents of a macro
invocation. The code for macro expansion is in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/libsyntax/ext/tt"><code>src/libsyntax/ext/tt/</code></a>. This chapter aims to explain how macro
expansion works.</p>
<a class="header" href="#example" id="example"><h3>Example</h3></a>
<p>It's helpful to have an example to refer to. For the remainder of this chapter,
whenever we refer to the &quot;example <em>definition</em>&quot;, we mean the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro_rules! printer {
    (print $mvar:ident) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
    }
    (print twice $mvar:ident) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>$mvar</code> is called a <em>metavariable</em>. Unlike normal variables, rather than
binding to a value in a computation, a metavariable binds <em>at compile time</em> to
a tree of <em>tokens</em>.  A <em>token</em> is a single &quot;unit&quot; of the grammar, such as an
identifier (e.g. <code>foo</code>) or punctuation (e.g. <code>=&gt;</code>). There are also other
special tokens, such as <code>EOF</code>, which indicates that there are no more tokens.
Token trees resulting from paired parentheses-like characters (<code>(</code>...<code>)</code>,
<code>[</code>...<code>]</code>, and <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>) – they include the open and close and all the tokens
in between (we do require that parentheses-like characters be balanced). Having
macro expansion operate on token streams rather than the raw bytes of a source
file abstracts away a lot of complexity. The macro expander (and much of the
rest of the compiler) doesn't really care that much about the exact line and
column of some syntactic construct in the code; it cares about what constructs
are used in the code. Using tokens allows us to care about <em>what</em> without
worrying about <em>where</em>. For more information about tokens, see the
<a href="./the-parser.html">Parsing</a> chapter of this book.</p>
<p>Whenever we refer to the &quot;example <em>invocation</em>&quot;, we mean the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">printer!(print foo); // Assume `foo` is a variable defined somewhere else...
</code></pre>
<p>The process of expanding the macro invocation into the syntax tree
<code>println!(&quot;{}&quot;, foo)</code> and then expanding that into a call to <code>Display::fmt</code> is
called <em>macro expansion</em>, and it is the topic of this chapter.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-macro-parser" id="the-macro-parser"><h3>The macro parser</h3></a>
<p>There are two parts to macro expansion: parsing the definition and parsing the
invocations. Interestingly, both are done by the macro parser.</p>
<p>Basically, the macro parser is like an NFA-based regex parser. It uses an
algorithm similar in spirit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser">Earley parsing
algorithm</a>. The macro parser is
defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ext/tt/macro_parser/"><code>src/libsyntax/ext/tt/macro_parser.rs</code></a>.</p>
<p>The interface of the macro parser is as follows (this is slightly simplified):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn parse(
    sess: ParserSession,
    tts: TokenStream,
    ms: &amp;[TokenTree]
) -&gt; NamedParseResult
</code></pre>
<p>In this interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sess</code> is a &quot;parsing session&quot;, which keeps track of some metadata. Most
notably, this is used to keep track of errors that are generated so they can
be reported to the user.</li>
<li><code>tts</code> is a stream of tokens. The macro parser's job is to consume the raw
stream of tokens and output a binding of metavariables to corresponding token
trees.</li>
<li><code>ms</code> a <em>matcher</em>. This is a sequence of token trees that we want to match
<code>tts</code> against.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the analogy of a regex parser, <code>tts</code> is the input and we are matching it
against the pattern <code>ms</code>. Using our examples, <code>tts</code> could be the stream of
tokens containing the inside of the example invocation <code>print foo</code>, while <code>ms</code>
might be the sequence of token (trees) <code>print $mvar:ident</code>.</p>
<p>The output of the parser is a <code>NamedParseResult</code>, which indicates which of
three cases has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: <code>tts</code> matches the given matcher <code>ms</code>, and we have produced a binding
from metavariables to the corresponding token trees.</li>
<li>Failure: <code>tts</code> does not match <code>ms</code>. This results in an error message such as
&quot;No rule expected token <em>blah</em>&quot;.</li>
<li>Error: some fatal error has occurred <em>in the parser</em>. For example, this
happens if there are more than one pattern match, since that indicates
the macro is ambiguous.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full interface is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ext/tt/macro_parser/fn.parse.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The macro parser does pretty much exactly the same as a normal regex parser with
one exception: in order to parse different types of metavariables, such as
<code>ident</code>, <code>block</code>, <code>expr</code>, etc., the macro parser must sometimes call back to the
normal Rust parser.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, both definitions and invocations of macros are parsed using
the macro parser. This is extremely non-intuitive and self-referential. The code
to parse macro <em>definitions</em> is in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ext/tt/macro_rules/"><code>src/libsyntax/ext/tt/macro_rules.rs</code></a>. It defines the pattern for
matching for a macro definition as <code>$( $lhs:tt =&gt; $rhs:tt );+</code>. In other words,
a <code>macro_rules</code> definition should have in its body at least one occurrence of a
token tree followed by <code>=&gt;</code> followed by another token tree. When the compiler
comes to a <code>macro_rules</code> definition, it uses this pattern to match the two token
trees per rule in the definition of the macro <em>using the macro parser itself</em>.
In our example definition, the metavariable <code>$lhs</code> would match the patterns of
both arms: <code>(print $mvar:ident)</code> and <code>(print twice $mvar:ident)</code>.  And <code>$rhs</code>
would match the bodies of both arms: <code>{ println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); }</code> and <code>{ println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); }</code>. The parser would keep this
knowledge around for when it needs to expand a macro invocation.</p>
<p>When the compiler comes to a macro invocation, it parses that invocation using
the same NFA-based macro parser that is described above. However, the matcher
used is the first token tree (<code>$lhs</code>) extracted from the arms of the macro
<em>definition</em>. Using our example, we would try to match the token stream <code>print foo</code> from the invocation against the matchers <code>print $mvar:ident</code> and <code>print twice $mvar:ident</code> that we previously extracted from the definition.  The
algorithm is exactly the same, but when the macro parser comes to a place in the
current matcher where it needs to match a <em>non-terminal</em> (e.g. <code>$mvar:ident</code>),
it calls back to the normal Rust parser to get the contents of that
non-terminal. In this case, the Rust parser would look for an <code>ident</code> token,
which it finds (<code>foo</code>) and returns to the macro parser. Then, the macro parser
proceeds in parsing as normal. Also, note that exactly one of the matchers from
the various arms should match the invocation; if there is more than one match,
the parse is ambiguous, while if there are no matches at all, there is a syntax
error.</p>
<p>For more information about the macro parser's implementation, see the comments
in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ext/tt/macro_parser/"><code>src/libsyntax/ext/tt/macro_parser.rs</code></a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hygiene" id="hygiene"><h3>Hygiene</h3></a>
<p>If you have ever used C/C++ preprocessor macros, you know that there are some
annoying and hard-to-debug gotchas! For example, consider the following C code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define DEFINE_FOO struct Bar {int x;}; struct Foo {Bar bar;};

// Then, somewhere else
struct Bar {
    ...
};

DEFINE_FOO
</code></pre>
<p>Most people avoid writing C like this – and for good reason: it doesn't
compile. The <code>struct Bar</code> defined by the macro clashes names with the <code>struct Bar</code> defined in the code. Consider also the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define DO_FOO(x) {\
    int y = 0;\
    foo(x, y);\
    }

// Then elsewhere
int y = 22;
DO_FOO(y);
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see the problem? We wanted to generate a call <code>foo(22, 0)</code>, but instead
we got <code>foo(0, 0)</code> because the macro defined its own <code>y</code>!</p>
<p>These are both examples of <em>macro hygiene</em> issues. <em>Hygiene</em> relates to how to
handle names defined <em>within a macro</em>. In particular, a hygienic macro system
prevents errors due to names introduced within a macro. Rust macros are hygienic
in that they do not allow one to write the sorts of bugs above.</p>
<p>At a high level, hygiene within the rust compiler is accomplished by keeping
track of the context where a name is introduced and used. We can then
disambiguate names based on that context. Future iterations of the macro system
will allow greater control to the macro author to use that context. For example,
a macro author may want to introduce a new name to the context where the macro
was called. Alternately, the macro author may be defining a variable for use
only within the macro (i.e. it should not be visible outside the macro).</p>
<p>In rustc, this &quot;context&quot; is tracked via <code>Span</code>s.</p>
<p>TODO: what is call-site hygiene? what is def-site hygiene?</p>

<p>TODO: maybe something about macros 2.0?</p>
<a class="header" href="#name-resolution" id="name-resolution"><h1>Name resolution</h1></a>
<p>The name resolution is a two-phase process. In the first phase, which runs
during macro expansion, we build a tree of modules and resolve imports. Macro
expansion and name resolution communicate with each other via the <code>Resolver</code>
trait, defined in <code>libsyntax</code>.</p>
<p>The input to the second phase is the syntax tree, produced by parsing input
files and expanding macros. This phase produces links from all the names in the
source to relevant places where the name was introduced. It also generates
helpful error messages, like typo suggestions, traits to import or lints about
unused items.</p>
<p>A successful run of the second phase (<code>Resolver::resolve_crate</code>) creates kind
of an index the rest of the compilation may use to ask about the present names
(through the <code>hir::lowering::Resolver</code> interface).</p>
<p>The name resolution lives in the <code>librustc_resolve</code> crate, with the meat in
<code>lib.rs</code> and some helpers or symbol-type specific logic in the other modules.</p>
<a class="header" href="#namespaces" id="namespaces"><h2>Namespaces</h2></a>
<p>Different kind of symbols live in different namespaces ‒ eg. types don't
clash with variables. This usually doesn't happen, because variables start with
lower-case letter while types with upper case one, but this is only a
convention. This is legal Rust code that'll compile (with warnings):</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
type x = u32;
let x: x = 1;
let y: x = 2; // See? x is still a type here.
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>To cope with this, and with slightly different scoping rules for these
namespaces, the resolver keeps them separated and builds separate structures for
them.</p>
<p>In other words, when the code talks about namespaces, it doesn't mean the module
hierarchy, it's types vs. values vs. macros.</p>
<a class="header" href="#scopes-and-ribs" id="scopes-and-ribs"><h2>Scopes and ribs</h2></a>
<p>A name is visible only in certain area in the source code. This forms a
hierarchical structure, but not necessarily a simple one ‒ if one scope is
part of another, it doesn't mean the name visible in the outer one is also
visible in the inner one, or that it refers to the same thing.</p>
<p>To cope with that, the compiler introduces the concept of Ribs. This is
abstraction of a scope. Every time the set of visible names potentially changes,
a new rib is pushed onto a stack. The places where this can happen includes for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious places ‒ curly braces enclosing a block, function boundaries,
modules.</li>
<li>Introducing a let binding ‒ this can shadow another binding with the same
name.</li>
<li>Macro expansion border ‒ to cope with macro hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>When searching for a name, the stack of ribs is traversed from the innermost
outwards. This helps to find the closest meaning of the name (the one not
shadowed by anything else). The transition to outer rib may also change the
rules what names are usable ‒ if there are nested functions (not closures),
the inner one can't access parameters and local bindings of the outer one,
even though they should be visible by ordinary scoping rules. An example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn do_something&lt;T: Default&gt;(val: T) { // &lt;- New rib in both types and values (1)
    // `val` is accessible, as is the helper function
    // `T` is accessible
    let helper = || { // New rib on `helper` (2) and another on the block (3)
        // `val` is accessible here
    }; // End of (3)
    // `val` is accessible, `helper` variable shadows `helper` function
    fn helper() { // &lt;- New rib in both types and values (4)
        // `val` is not accessible here, (4) is not transparent for locals)
        // `T` is not accessible here
    } // End of (4)
    let val = T::default(); // New rib (5)
    // `val` is the variable, not the parameter here
} // End of (5), (2) and (1)
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Because the rules for different namespaces are a bit different, each namespace
has its own independent rib stack that is constructed in parallel to the others.
In addition, there's also a rib stack for local labels (eg. names of loops or
blocks), which isn't a full namespace in its own right.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overall-strategy" id="overall-strategy"><h2>Overall strategy</h2></a>
<p>To perform the name resolution of the whole crate, the syntax tree is traversed
top-down and every encountered name is resolved. This works for most kinds of
names, because at the point of use of a name it is already introduced in the Rib
hierarchy.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this. Items are bit tricky, because they can be
used even before encountered ‒ therefore every block needs to be first scanned
for items to fill in its Rib.</p>
<p>Other, even more problematic ones, are imports which need recursive fixed-point
resolution and macros, that need to be resolved and expanded before the rest of
the code can be processed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the resolution is performed in multiple stages.</p>
<a class="header" href="#todo" id="todo"><h2>TODO:</h2></a>
<p>This is a result of the first pass of learning the code. It is definitely
incomplete and not detailed enough. It also might be inaccurate in places.
Still, it probably provides useful first guidepost to what happens in there.</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly does it link to and how is that published and consumed by
following stages of compilation?</li>
<li>Who calls it and how it is actually used.</li>
<li>Is it a pass and then the result is only used, or can it be computed
incrementally (eg. for RLS)?</li>
<li>The overall strategy description is a bit vague.</li>
<li>Where does the name <code>Rib</code> come from?</li>
<li>Does this thing have its own tests, or is it tested only as part of some e2e

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#the-hir" id="the-hir"><h1>The HIR</h1></a>
<p>The HIR – &quot;High-Level Intermediate Representation&quot; – is the primary IR used
in most of rustc. It is a compiler-friendly representation of the abstract
syntax tree (AST) that is generated after parsing, macro expansion, and name
resolution (see <a href="./lowering.html">Lowering</a> for how the HIR is created).
Many parts of HIR resemble Rust surface syntax quite closely, with
the exception that some of Rust's expression forms have been desugared away.
For example, <code>for</code> loops are converted into a <code>loop</code> and do not appear in
the HIR. This makes HIR more amenable to analysis than a normal AST.</p>
<p>This chapter covers the main concepts of the HIR.</p>
<p>You can view the HIR representation of your code by passing the
<code>-Zunpretty=hir-tree</code> flag to rustc:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cargo rustc -- -Zunpretty=hir-tree
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#out-of-band-storage-and-the-crate-type" id="out-of-band-storage-and-the-crate-type"><h3>Out-of-band storage and the <code>Crate</code> type</h3></a>
<p>The top-level data-structure in the HIR is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.Crate.html"><code>Crate</code></a>, which stores
the contents of the crate currently being compiled (we only ever
construct HIR for the current crate). Whereas in the AST the crate
data structure basically just contains the root module, the HIR
<code>Crate</code> structure contains a number of maps and other things that
serve to organize the content of the crate for easier access.</p>
<p>For example, the contents of individual items (e.g. modules,
functions, traits, impls, etc) in the HIR are not immediately
accessible in the parents. So, for example, if there is a module item
<code>foo</code> containing a function <code>bar()</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
mod foo {
    fn bar() { }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>then in the HIR the representation of module <code>foo</code> (the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.Mod.html"><code>Mod</code></a>
struct) would only have the <strong><code>ItemId</code></strong> <code>I</code> of <code>bar()</code>. To get the
details of the function <code>bar()</code>, we would lookup <code>I</code> in the
<code>items</code> map.</p>
<p>One nice result from this representation is that one can iterate
over all items in the crate by iterating over the key-value pairs
in these maps (without the need to trawl through the whole HIR).
There are similar maps for things like trait items and impl items,
as well as &quot;bodies&quot; (explained below).</p>
<p>The other reason to set up the representation this way is for better
integration with incremental compilation. This way, if you gain access
to an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.Item.html"><code>&amp;hir::Item</code></a> (e.g. for the mod <code>foo</code>), you do not immediately
gain access to the contents of the function <code>bar()</code>. Instead, you only
gain access to the <strong>id</strong> for <code>bar()</code>, and you must invoke some
function to lookup the contents of <code>bar()</code> given its id; this gives
the compiler a chance to observe that you accessed the data for
<code>bar()</code>, and then record the dependency.</p>
<p><a name="hir-id"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#identifiers-in-the-hir" id="identifiers-in-the-hir"><h3>Identifiers in the HIR</h3></a>
<p>Most of the code that has to deal with things in HIR tends not to
carry around references into the HIR, but rather to carry around
<em>identifier numbers</em> (or just &quot;ids&quot;). Right now, you will find four
sorts of identifiers in active use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>, which primarily names &quot;definitions&quot; or top-level items.
<ul>
<li>You can think of a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a> as being shorthand for a very explicit
and complete path, like <code>std::collections::HashMap</code>. However,
these paths are able to name things that are not nameable in
normal Rust (e.g. impls), and they also include extra information
about the crate (such as its version number, as two versions of
the same crate can co-exist).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a> really consists of two parts, a <code>CrateNum</code> (which
identifies the crate) and a <code>DefIndex</code> (which indexes into a list
of items that is maintained per crate).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a>, which combines the index of a particular item with an
offset within that item.
<ul>
<li>the key point of a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a> is that it is <em>relative</em> to some item
(which is named via a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.BodyId.html"><code>BodyId</code></a>, this is an absolute identifier that refers to a specific
body (definition of a function or constant) in the crate. It is currently
effectively a &quot;newtype'd&quot; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>, which is an absolute id that identifies a single node in the HIR
tree.
<ul>
<li>While these are still in common use, <strong>they are being slowly phased out</strong>.</li>
<li>Since they are absolute within the crate, adding a new node anywhere in the
tree causes the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>s of all subsequent code in the crate to change.
This is terrible for incremental compilation, as you can perhaps imagine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#the-hir-map" id="the-hir-map"><h3>The HIR Map</h3></a>
<p>Most of the time when you are working with the HIR, you will do so via
the <strong>HIR Map</strong>, accessible in the tcx via <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/context/struct.GlobalCtxt.html#structfield.hir_map"><code>tcx.hir_map</code></a> (and defined in
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/index.html"><code>hir::map</code></a> module). The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html">HIR map</a> contains a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#methods">number of methods</a> to
convert between IDs of various kinds and to lookup data associated
with an HIR node.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>, and you would like to convert it
to a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>, you can use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.as_local_node_id"><code>tcx.hir.as_local_node_id(def_id)</code></a>. This returns
an <code>Option&lt;NodeId&gt;</code> – this will be <code>None</code> if the def-id refers to
something outside of the current crate (since then it has no HIR
node), but otherwise returns <code>Some(n)</code> where <code>n</code> is the node-id of the
definition.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.find"><code>tcx.hir.find(n)</code></a> to lookup the node for a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/ast/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>. This returns a <code>Option&lt;Node&lt;'tcx&gt;&gt;</code>, where <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/enum.Node.html"><code>Node</code></a> is an enum
defined in the map; by matching on this you can find out what sort of
node the node-id referred to and also get a pointer to the data
itself. Often, you know what sort of node <code>n</code> is – e.g. if you know
that <code>n</code> must be some HIR expression, you can do
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.expect_expr"><code>tcx.hir.expect_expr(n)</code></a>, which will extract and return the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.Expr.html"><code>&amp;hir::Expr</code></a>, panicking if <code>n</code> is not in fact an expression.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the HIR map to find the parents of nodes, via
calls like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.get_parent_node"><code>tcx.hir.get_parent_node(n)</code></a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hir-bodies" id="hir-bodies"><h3>HIR Bodies</h3></a>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/struct.Body.html"><code>hir::Body</code></a> represents some kind of executable code, such as the body
of a function/closure or the definition of a constant. Bodies are
associated with an <strong>owner</strong>, which is typically some kind of item
(e.g. an <code>fn()</code> or <code>const</code>), but could also be a closure expression
(e.g. <code>|x, y| x + y</code>). You can use the HIR map to find the body
associated with a given def-id (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.maybe_body_owned_by"><code>maybe_body_owned_by</code></a>) or to find
the owner of a body (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.body_owner_def_id"><code>body_owner_def_id</code></a>).</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering" id="lowering"><h1>Lowering</h1></a>
<p>The lowering step converts AST to <a href="hir.html">HIR</a>.
This means many structures are removed if they are irrelevant
for type analysis or similar syntax agnostic analyses. Examples
of such structures include but are not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>Parenthesis
<ul>
<li>Removed without replacement, the tree structure makes order explicit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>for</code> loops and <code>while (let)</code> loops
<ul>
<li>Converted to <code>loop</code> + <code>match</code> and some <code>let</code> bindings</li>

<li><code>if let</code>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering needs to uphold several invariants in order to not trigger the
sanity checks in <code>src/librustc/hir/map/hir_id_validator.rs</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>HirId</code> must be used if created. So if you use the <code>lower_node_id</code>,
you <em>must</em> use the resulting <code>NodeId</code> or <code>HirId</code> (either is fine, since
any <code>NodeId</code>s in the <code>HIR</code> are checked for existing <code>HirId</code>s)</li>
<li>Lowering a <code>HirId</code> must be done in the scope of the <em>owning</em> item.
This means you need to use <code>with_hir_id_owner</code> if you are creating parts
of an item other than the one being currently lowered. This happens for
example during the lowering of existential <code>impl Trait</code></li>
<li>A <code>NodeId</code> that will be placed into a HIR structure must be lowered,
even if its <code>HirId</code> is unused. Calling
<code>let _ = self.lower_node_id(node_id);</code> is perfectly legitimate.</li>
<li>If you are creating new nodes that didn't exist in the <code>AST</code>, you <em>must</em>
create new ids for them. This is done by calling the <code>next_id</code> method,
which produces both a new <code>NodeId</code> as well as automatically lowering it
for you so you also get the <code>HirId</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are creating new <code>DefId</code>s, since each <code>DefId</code> needs to have a
corresponding <code>NodeId</code>, it is advisable to add these <code>NodeId</code>s to the
<code>AST</code> so you don't have to generate new ones during lowering. This has
the advantage of creating a way to find the <code>DefId</code> of something via its
<code>NodeId</code>. If lowering needs this <code>DefId</code> in multiple places, you can't
generate a new <code>NodeId</code> in all those places because you'd also get a new
<code>DefId</code> then. With a <code>NodeId</code> from the <code>AST</code> this is not an issue.</p>
<p>Having the <code>NodeId</code> also allows the <code>DefCollector</code> to generate the <code>DefId</code>s
instead of lowering having to do it on the fly. Centralizing the <code>DefId</code>
generation in one place makes it easier to refactor and reason about.</p>
<a class="header" href="#hir-debugging" id="hir-debugging"><h1>HIR Debugging</h1></a>
<p>The <code>-Zunpretty=hir-tree</code> flag will dump out the HIR.</p>
<p>If you are trying to correlate <code>NodeId</code>s or <code>DefId</code>s with source code, the

<p>TODO: anything else?</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-ty-module-representing-types" id="the-ty-module-representing-types"><h1>The <code>ty</code> module: representing types</h1></a>
<p>The <code>ty</code> module defines how the Rust compiler represents types
internally. It also defines the <em>typing context</em> (<code>tcx</code> or <code>TyCtxt</code>),
which is the central data structure in the compiler.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-tcx-and-how-it-uses-lifetimes" id="the-tcx-and-how-it-uses-lifetimes"><h2>The tcx and how it uses lifetimes</h2></a>
<p>The <code>tcx</code> (&quot;typing context&quot;) is the central data structure in the
compiler. It is the context that you use to perform all manner of
queries. The struct <code>TyCtxt</code> defines a reference to this shared context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'a, 'gcx, 'tcx&gt;
//          --  ----  ----
//          |   |     |
//          |   |     innermost arena lifetime (if any)
//          |   &quot;global arena&quot; lifetime
//          lifetime of this reference
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>TyCtxt</code> type takes three lifetime parameters.
These lifetimes are perhaps the most complex thing to understand about
the tcx. During Rust compilation, we allocate most of our memory in
<strong>arenas</strong>, which are basically pools of memory that get freed all at
once. When you see a reference with a lifetime like <code>'tcx</code> or <code>'gcx</code>,
you know that it refers to arena-allocated data (or data that lives as
long as the arenas, anyhow).</p>
<p>We use two distinct levels of arenas. The outer level is the &quot;global
arena&quot;. This arena lasts for the entire compilation: so anything you
allocate in there is only freed once compilation is basically over
(actually, when we shift to executing LLVM).</p>
<p>To reduce peak memory usage, when we do type inference, we also use an
inner level of arena. These arenas get thrown away once type inference
is over. This is done because type inference generates a lot of
&quot;throw-away&quot; types that are not particularly interesting after type
inference completes, so keeping around those allocations would be
wasteful.</p>
<p>Often, we wish to write code that explicitly asserts that it is not
taking place during inference. In that case, there is no &quot;local&quot;
arena, and all the types that you can access are allocated in the
global arena.  To express this, the idea is to use the same lifetime
for the <code>'gcx</code> and <code>'tcx</code> parameters of <code>TyCtxt</code>. Just to be a touch
confusing, we tend to use the name <code>'tcx</code> in such contexts. Here is an
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn not_in_inference&lt;'a, 'tcx&gt;(tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'a, 'tcx, 'tcx&gt;, def_id: DefId) {
    //                                        ----  ----
    //                                        Using the same lifetime here asserts
    //                                        that the innermost arena accessible through
    //                                        this reference *is* the global arena.
}
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, if we want to code that can be usable during type inference, then
you need to declare a distinct <code>'gcx</code> and <code>'tcx</code> lifetime parameter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn maybe_in_inference&lt;'a, 'gcx, 'tcx&gt;(tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'a, 'gcx, 'tcx&gt;, def_id: DefId) {
    //                                                ----  ----
    //                                        Using different lifetimes here means that
    //                                        the innermost arena *may* be distinct
    //                                        from the global arena (but doesn't have to be).
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#allocating-and-working-with-types" id="allocating-and-working-with-types"><h3>Allocating and working with types</h3></a>
<p>Rust types are represented using the <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> defined in the <code>ty</code>
module (not to be confused with the <code>Ty</code> struct from <a href="./hir.html">the HIR</a>). This
is in fact a simple type alias for a reference with <code>'tcx</code> lifetime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub type Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; = &amp;'tcx TyS&lt;'tcx&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>You can basically ignore the <code>TyS</code> struct – you will basically never
access it explicitly. We always pass it by reference using the
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> alias – the only exception I think is to define inherent
methods on types. Instances of <code>TyS</code> are only ever allocated in one of
the rustc arenas (never e.g. on the stack).</p>
<p>One common operation on types is to <strong>match</strong> and see what kinds of
types they are. This is done by doing <code>match ty.sty</code>, sort of like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn test_type&lt;'tcx&gt;(ty: Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;) {
    match ty.sty {
        ty::TyArray(elem_ty, len) =&gt; { ... }
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>sty</code> field (the origin of this name is unclear to me; perhaps
structural type?) is of type <code>TyKind&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, which is an enum
defining all of the different kinds of types in the compiler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B. inspecting the <code>sty</code> field on types during type inference can be
risky, as there may be inference variables and other things to
consider, or sometimes types are not yet known that will become
known later.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To allocate a new type, you can use the various <code>mk_</code> methods defined
on the <code>tcx</code>. These have names that correpond mostly to the various kinds
of type variants. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let array_ty = tcx.mk_array(elem_ty, len * 2);
</code></pre>
<p>These methods all return a <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> – note that the lifetime you
get back is the lifetime of the innermost arena that this <code>tcx</code> has
access to. In fact, types are always canonicalized and interned (so we
never allocate exactly the same type twice) and are always allocated
in the outermost arena where they can be (so, if they do not contain
any inference variables or other &quot;temporary&quot; types, they will be
allocated in the global arena). However, the lifetime <code>'tcx</code> is always
a safe approximation, so that is what you get back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NB. Because types are interned, it is possible to compare them for
equality efficiently using <code>==</code> – however, this is almost never what
you want to do unless you happen to be hashing and looking for
duplicates. This is because often in Rust there are multiple ways to
represent the same type, particularly once inference is involved. If
you are going to be testing for type equality, you probably need to
start looking into the inference code to do it right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also find various common types in the <code>tcx</code> itself by accessing
<code>tcx.types.bool</code>, <code>tcx.types.char</code>, etc (see <code>CommonTypes</code> for more).</p>
<a class="header" href="#beyond-types-other-kinds-of-arena-allocated-data-structures" id="beyond-types-other-kinds-of-arena-allocated-data-structures"><h3>Beyond types: other kinds of arena-allocated data structures</h3></a>
<p>In addition to types, there are a number of other arena-allocated data
structures that you can allocate, and which are found in this
module. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./kinds.html#subst"><code>Substs</code></a>, allocated with <code>mk_substs</code> – this will intern a slice of
types, often used to specify the values to be substituted for generics
(e.g. <code>HashMap&lt;i32, u32&gt;</code> would be represented as a slice
<code>&amp;'tcx [tcx.types.i32, tcx.types.u32]</code>).</li>
<li><code>TraitRef</code>, typically passed by value – a <strong>trait reference</strong>
consists of a reference to a trait along with its various type
parameters (including <code>Self</code>), like <code>i32: Display</code> (here, the def-id
would reference the <code>Display</code> trait, and the substs would contain
<code>i32</code>).</li>
<li><code>Predicate</code> defines something the trait system has to prove (see <code>traits</code>
module).</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#import-conventions" id="import-conventions"><h3>Import conventions</h3></a>
<p>Although there is no hard and fast rule, the <code>ty</code> module tends to be used like
so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use ty::{self, Ty, TyCtxt};
</code></pre>
<p>In particular, since they are so common, the <code>Ty</code> and <code>TyCtxt</code> types
are imported directly. Other types are often referenced with an
explicit <code>ty::</code> prefix (e.g. <code>ty::TraitRef&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>). But some modules
choose to import a larger or smaller set of names explicitly.</p>
<a class="header" href="#kinds" id="kinds"><h1>Kinds</h1></a>
<p>A <code>ty::subst::Kind&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> represents some entity in the type system: a type
(<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>), lifetime (<code>ty::Region&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>) or constant (<code>ty::Const&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>).
<code>Kind</code> is used to perform substitutions of generic parameters for concrete
arguments, such as when calling a function with generic parameters explicitly
with type arguments. Substitutions are represented using the
<a href="#subst"><code>Subst</code> type</a> as described below.</p>
<a class="header" href="#subst" id="subst"><h2><code>Subst</code></h2></a>
<p><code>ty::subst::Subst&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> is intuitively simply a slice of <code>Kind&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>s,
acting as an ordered list of substitutions from generic parameters to
concrete arguments (such as types, lifetimes and consts).</p>
<p>For example, given a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> with two type parameters, <code>K</code> and <code>V</code>, an
instantiation of the parameters, for example <code>HashMap&lt;i32, u32&gt;</code>, would be
represented by the substitution <code>&amp;'tcx [tcx.types.i32, tcx.types.u32]</code>.</p>
<p><code>Subst</code> provides various convenience methods to instantiant substitutions
given item definitions, which should generally be used rather than explicitly
constructing such substitution slices.</p>
<a class="header" href="#kind" id="kind"><h2><code>Kind</code></h2></a>
<p>The actual <code>Kind</code> struct is optimised for space, storing the type, lifetime or
const as an interned pointer containing a tag identifying its kind (in the
lowest 2 bits). Unless you are working with the <code>Subst</code> implementation
specifically, you should generally not have to deal with <code>Kind</code> and instead
make use of the safe <a href="#unpackedkind"><code>UnpackedKind</code></a> abstraction.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unpackedkind" id="unpackedkind"><h2><code>UnpackedKind</code></h2></a>
<p>As <code>Kind</code> itself is not type-safe, the <code>UnpackedKind</code> enum provides a more
convenient and safe interface for dealing with kinds. An <code>UnpackedKind</code> can
be converted to a raw <code>Kind</code> using <code>Kind::from()</code> (or simply <code>.into()</code> when
the context is clear). As mentioned earlier, substition lists store raw
<code>Kind</code>s, so before dealing with them, it is preferable to convert them to
<code>UnpackedKind</code>s first. This is done by calling the <code>.unpack()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// An example of unpacking and packing a kind.
fn deal_with_kind&lt;'tcx&gt;(kind: Kind&lt;'tcx&gt;) -&gt; Kind&lt;'tcx&gt; {
    // Unpack a raw `Kind` to deal with it safely.
    let new_kind: UnpackedKind&lt;'tcx&gt; = match kind.unpack() {
        UnpackedKind::Type(ty) =&gt; { /* ... */ }
        UnpackedKind::Lifetime(lt) =&gt; { /* ... */ }
        UnpackedKind::Const(ct) =&gt; { /* ... */ }
    };
    // Pack the `UnpackedKind` to store it in a substitution list.
    new_kind.into()
}
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#type-inference" id="type-inference"><h1>Type inference</h1></a>
<p>Type inference is the process of automatic detection of the type of an
expression.</p>
<p>It is what allows Rust to work with fewer or no type annotations,
making things easier for users:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let mut things = vec![];
    things.push(&quot;thing&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the type of <code>things</code> is <em>inferenced</em> to be <code>&amp;str</code> because that's the value
we push into <code>things</code>.</p>
<p>The type inference is based on the standard Hindley-Milner (HM) type inference
algorithm, but extended in various way to accommodate subtyping, region
inference, and higher-ranked types.</p>
<a class="header" href="#a-note-on-terminology" id="a-note-on-terminology"><h2>A note on terminology</h2></a>
<p>We use the notation <code>?T</code> to refer to inference variables, also called
existential variables.</p>
<p>We use the terms &quot;region&quot; and &quot;lifetime&quot; interchangeably. Both refer to
the <code>'a</code> in <code>&amp;'a T</code>.</p>
<p>The term &quot;bound region&quot; refers to a region that is bound in a function
signature, such as the <code>'a</code> in <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>. A region is
&quot;free&quot; if it is not bound.</p>
<a class="header" href="#creating-an-inference-context" id="creating-an-inference-context"><h2>Creating an inference context</h2></a>
<p>You create and &quot;enter&quot; an inference context by doing something like
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">tcx.infer_ctxt().enter(|infcx| {
    // Use the inference context `infcx` here.
})
</code></pre>
<p>Each inference context creates a short-lived type arena to store the
fresh types and things that it will create, as described in the
<a href="ty.html">chapter on the <code>ty</code> module</a>. This arena is created by the <code>enter</code>
function and disposed of after it returns.</p>
<p>Within the closure, <code>infcx</code> has the type <code>InferCtxt&lt;'cx, 'gcx, 'tcx&gt;</code>
for some fresh <code>'cx</code> and <code>'tcx</code> – the latter corresponds to the lifetime of
this temporary arena, and the <code>'cx</code> is the lifetime of the <code>InferCtxt</code> itself.
(Again, see the <a href="ty.html"><code>ty</code> chapter</a> for more details on this setup.)</p>
<p>The <code>tcx.infer_ctxt</code> method actually returns a builder, which means
there are some kinds of configuration you can do before the <code>infcx</code> is
created. See <code>InferCtxtBuilder</code> for more information.</p>
<p><a name="vars"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#inference-variables" id="inference-variables"><h2>Inference variables</h2></a>
<p>The main purpose of the inference context is to house a bunch of
<strong>inference variables</strong> – these represent types or regions whose precise
value is not yet known, but will be uncovered as we perform type-checking.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with the basic ideas of unification from H-M type
systems, or logic languages like Prolog, this is the same concept. If
you're not, you might want to read a tutorial on how H-M type
inference works, or perhaps this blog post on
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2017/03/25/unification-in-chalk-part-1/">unification in the Chalk project</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the inference context stores four kinds of inference variables as of
this writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type variables, which come in three varieties:
<ul>
<li>General type variables (the most common). These can be unified with any
type.</li>
<li>Integral type variables, which can only be unified with an integral type,
and arise from an integer literal expression like <code>22</code>.</li>
<li>Float type variables, which can only be unified with a float type, and
arise from a float literal expression like <code>22.0</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Region variables, which represent lifetimes, and arise all over the place.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the type variables work in much the same way: you can create a new
type variable, and what you get is <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> representing an
unresolved type <code>?T</code>. Then later you can apply the various operations
that the inferencer supports, such as equality or subtyping, and it
will possibly <strong>instantiate</strong> (or <strong>bind</strong>) that <code>?T</code> to a specific
value as a result.</p>
<p>The region variables work somewhat differently, and are described
below in a separate section.</p>
<a class="header" href="#enforcing-equality--subtyping" id="enforcing-equality--subtyping"><h2>Enforcing equality / subtyping</h2></a>
<p>The most basic operations you can perform in the type inferencer is
<strong>equality</strong>, which forces two types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> to be the same. The
recommended way to add an equality constraint is to use the <code>at</code>
method, roughly like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">infcx.at(...).eq(t, u);
</code></pre>
<p>The first <code>at()</code> call provides a bit of context, i.e. why you are
doing this unification, and in what environment, and the <code>eq</code> method
performs the actual equality constraint.</p>
<p>When you equate things, you force them to be precisely equal. Equating
returns an <code>InferResult</code> – if it returns <code>Err(err)</code>, then equating
failed, and the enclosing <code>TypeError</code> will tell you what went wrong.</p>
<p>The success case is perhaps more interesting. The &quot;primary&quot; return
type of <code>eq</code> is <code>()</code> – that is, when it succeeds, it doesn't return a
value of any particular interest. Rather, it is executed for its
side-effects of constraining type variables and so forth. However, the
actual return type is not <code>()</code>, but rather <code>InferOk&lt;()&gt;</code>. The
<code>InferOk</code> type is used to carry extra trait obligations – your job is
to ensure that these are fulfilled (typically by enrolling them in a
fulfillment context). See the <a href="traits/resolution.html">trait chapter</a> for more background on that.</p>
<p>You can similarly enforce subtyping through <code>infcx.at(..).sub(..)</code>. The same
basic concepts as above apply.</p>
<a class="header" href="#trying-equality" id="trying-equality"><h2>&quot;Trying&quot; equality</h2></a>
<p>Sometimes you would like to know if it is <em>possible</em> to equate two
types without error.  You can test that with <code>infcx.can_eq</code> (or
<code>infcx.can_sub</code> for subtyping). If this returns <code>Ok</code>, then equality
is possible – but in all cases, any side-effects are reversed.</p>
<p>Be aware, though, that the success or failure of these methods is always
<strong>modulo regions</strong>. That is, two types <code>&amp;'a u32</code> and <code>&amp;'b u32</code> will
return <code>Ok</code> for <code>can_eq</code>, even if <code>'a != 'b</code>.  This falls out from the
&quot;two-phase&quot; nature of how we solve region constraints.</p>
<a class="header" href="#snapshots" id="snapshots"><h2>Snapshots</h2></a>
<p>As described in the previous section on <code>can_eq</code>, often it is useful
to be able to do a series of operations and then roll back their
side-effects. This is done for various reasons: one of them is to be
able to backtrack, trying out multiple possibilities before settling
on which path to take. Another is in order to ensure that a series of
smaller changes take place atomically or not at all.</p>
<p>To allow for this, the inference context supports a <code>snapshot</code> method.
When you call it, it will start recording changes that occur from the
operations you perform. When you are done, you can either invoke
<code>rollback_to</code>, which will undo those changes, or else <code>confirm</code>, which
will make the permanent. Snapshots can be nested as long as you follow
a stack-like discipline.</p>
<p>Rather than use snapshots directly, it is often helpful to use the
methods like <code>commit_if_ok</code> or <code>probe</code> that encapsulate higher-level
patterns.</p>
<a class="header" href="#subtyping-obligations" id="subtyping-obligations"><h2>Subtyping obligations</h2></a>
<p>One thing worth discussing is subtyping obligations. When you force
two types to be a subtype, like <code>?T &lt;: i32</code>, we can often convert those
into equality constraints. This follows from Rust's rather limited notion
of subtyping: so, in the above case, <code>?T &lt;: i32</code> is equivalent to <code>?T = i32</code>.</p>
<p>However, in some cases we have to be more careful. For example, when
regions are involved. So if you have <code>?T &lt;: &amp;'a i32</code>, what we would do
is to first &quot;generalize&quot; <code>&amp;'a i32</code> into a type with a region variable:
<code>&amp;'?b i32</code>, and then unify <code>?T</code> with that (<code>?T = &amp;'?b i32</code>). We then
relate this new variable with the original bound:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'?b i32 &lt;: &amp;'a i32
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in a region constraint (see below) of <code>'?b: 'a</code>.</p>
<p>One final interesting case is relating two unbound type variables,
like <code>?T &lt;: ?U</code>.  In that case, we can't make progress, so we enqueue
an obligation <code>Subtype(?T, ?U)</code> and return it via the <code>InferOk</code>
mechanism. You'll have to try again when more details about <code>?T</code> or
<code>?U</code> are known.</p>
<a class="header" href="#region-constraints" id="region-constraints"><h2>Region constraints</h2></a>
<p>Regions are inferenced somewhat differently from types. Rather than
eagerly unifying things, we simply collect constraints as we go, but
make (almost) no attempt to solve regions. These constraints have the
form of an &quot;outlives&quot; constraint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'a: 'b
</code></pre>
<p>Actually the code tends to view them as a subregion relation, but it's the same
idea:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'b &lt;= 'a
</code></pre>
<p>(There are various other kinds of constraints, such as &quot;verifys&quot;; see
the <code>region_constraints</code> module for details.)</p>
<p>There is one case where we do some amount of eager unification. If you have an
equality constraint between two regions</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'a = 'b
</code></pre>
<p>we will record that fact in a unification table. You can then use
<code>opportunistic_resolve_var</code> to convert <code>'b</code> to <code>'a</code> (or vice
versa). This is sometimes needed to ensure termination of fixed-point
algorithms.</p>
<a class="header" href="#extracting-region-constraints" id="extracting-region-constraints"><h2>Extracting region constraints</h2></a>
<p>Ultimately, region constraints are only solved at the very end of
type-checking, once all other constraints are known. There are two
ways to solve region constraints right now: lexical and
non-lexical. Eventually there will only be one.</p>
<p>To solve <strong>lexical</strong> region constraints, you invoke
<code>resolve_regions_and_report_errors</code>.  This &quot;closes&quot; the region
constraint process and invoke the <code>lexical_region_resolve</code> code. Once
this is done, any further attempt to equate or create a subtyping
relationship will yield an ICE.</p>
<p>Non-lexical region constraints are not handled within the inference
context. Instead, the NLL solver (actually, the MIR type-checker)
invokes <code>take_and_reset_region_constraints</code> periodically. This
extracts all of the outlives constraints from the region solver, but
leaves the set of variables intact. This is used to get <em>just</em> the
region constraints that resulted from some particular point in the
program, since the NLL solver needs to know not just <em>what</em> regions
were subregions but <em>where</em>. Finally, the NLL solver invokes
<code>take_region_var_origins</code>, which &quot;closes&quot; the region constraint
process in the same way as normal solving.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lexical-region-resolution" id="lexical-region-resolution"><h2>Lexical region resolution</h2></a>
<p>Lexical region resolution is done by initially assigning each region
variable to an empty value. We then process each outlives constraint
repeatedly, growing region variables until a fixed-point is reached.
Region variables can be grown using a least-upper-bound relation on
the region lattice in a fairly straightforward fashion.</p>

<a class="header" href="#major-concepts" id="major-concepts"><h2>Major concepts</h2></a>
<p>Trait resolution is the process of pairing up an impl with each
reference to a trait. So, for example, if there is a generic function like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn clone_slice&lt;T:Clone&gt;(x: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>and then a call to that function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let v: Vec&lt;isize&gt; = clone_slice(&amp;[1, 2, 3])
</code></pre>
<p>it is the job of trait resolution to figure out whether there exists an impl of
(in this case) <code>isize : Clone</code>.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, like generic functions, we may not be able to
find a specific impl, but we can figure out that the caller must
provide an impl. For example, consider the body of <code>clone_slice</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn clone_slice&lt;T:Clone&gt;(x: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    for e in &amp;x {
        v.push((*e).clone()); // (*)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The line marked <code>(*)</code> is only legal if <code>T</code> (the type of <code>*e</code>)
implements the <code>Clone</code> trait. Naturally, since we don't know what <code>T</code>
is, we can't find the specific impl; but based on the bound <code>T:Clone</code>,
we can say that there exists an impl which the caller must provide.</p>
<p>We use the term <em>obligation</em> to refer to a trait reference in need of
an impl. Basically, the trait resolution system resolves an obligation
by proving that an appropriate impl does exist.</p>
<p>During type checking, we do not store the results of trait selection.
We simply wish to verify that trait selection will succeed. Then
later, at trans time, when we have all concrete types available, we
can repeat the trait selection to choose an actual implementation, which
will then be generated in the output binary.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview-1" id="overview-1"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>Trait resolution consists of three major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>: Deciding how to resolve a specific obligation. For
example, selection might decide that a specific obligation can be
resolved by employing an impl which matches the <code>Self</code> type, or by using a
parameter bound (e.g. <code>T: Trait</code>). In the case of an impl, selecting one
obligation can create <em>nested obligations</em> because of where clauses
on the impl itself. It may also require evaluating those nested
obligations to resolve ambiguities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fulfillment</strong>: The fulfillment code is what tracks that obligations
are completely fulfilled. Basically it is a worklist of obligations
to be selected: once selection is successful, the obligation is
removed from the worklist and any nested obligations are enqueued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coherence</strong>: The coherence checks are intended to ensure that there
are never overlapping impls, where two impls could be used with
equal precedence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#selection" id="selection"><h2>Selection</h2></a>
<p>Selection is the process of deciding whether an obligation can be
resolved and, if so, how it is to be resolved (via impl, where clause, etc).
The main interface is the <code>select()</code> function, which takes an obligation
and returns a <code>SelectionResult</code>. There are three possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(Some(selection))</code> – yes, the obligation can be resolved, and
<code>selection</code> indicates how. If the impl was resolved via an impl,
then <code>selection</code> may also indicate nested obligations that are required
by the impl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(None)</code> – we are not yet sure whether the obligation can be
resolved or not. This happens most commonly when the obligation
contains unbound type variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Err(err)</code> – the obligation definitely cannot be resolved due to a
type error or because there are no impls that could possibly apply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic algorithm for selection is broken into two big phases:
candidate assembly and confirmation.</p>
<p>Note that because of how lifetime inference works, it is not possible to
give back immediate feedback as to whether a unification or subtype
relationship between lifetimes holds or not. Therefore, lifetime
matching is <em>not</em> considered during selection. This is reflected in
the fact that subregion assignment is infallible. This may yield
lifetime constraints that will later be found to be in error (in
contrast, the non-lifetime-constraints have already been checked
during selection and can never cause an error, though naturally they
may lead to other errors downstream).</p>
<a class="header" href="#candidate-assembly" id="candidate-assembly"><h3>Candidate assembly</h3></a>
<p>Searches for impls/where-clauses/etc that might
possibly be used to satisfy the obligation. Each of those is called
a candidate. To avoid ambiguity, we want to find exactly one
candidate that is definitively applicable. In some cases, we may not
know whether an impl/where-clause applies or not – this occurs when
the obligation contains unbound inference variables.</p>
<p>The subroutines that decide whether a particular impl/where-clause/etc
applies to a particular obligation are collectively referred to as the
process of <em>matching</em>. At the moment, this amounts to
unifying the <code>Self</code> types, but in the future we may also recursively
consider some of the nested obligations, in the case of an impl.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: what does &quot;unifying the <code>Self</code> types&quot; mean? The <code>Self</code> of the
obligation with that of an impl?</p>
<p>The basic idea for candidate assembly is to do a first pass in which
we identify all possible candidates. During this pass, all that we do
is try and unify the type parameters. (In particular, we ignore any
nested where clauses.) Presuming that this unification succeeds, the
impl is added as a candidate.</p>
<p>Once this first pass is done, we can examine the set of candidates. If
it is a singleton set, then we are done: this is the only impl in
scope that could possibly apply. Otherwise, we can winnow down the set
of candidates by using where clauses and other conditions. If this
reduced set yields a single, unambiguous entry, we're good to go,
otherwise the result is considered ambiguous.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-basic-process-inferring-based-on-the-impls-we-see" id="the-basic-process-inferring-based-on-the-impls-we-see"><h4>The basic process: Inferring based on the impls we see</h4></a>
<p>This process is easier if we work through some examples. Consider
the following trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Convert&lt;Target&gt; {
    fn convert(&amp;self) -&gt; Target;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This trait just has one method. It's about as simple as it gets. It
converts from the (implicit) <code>Self</code> type to the <code>Target</code> type. If we
wanted to permit conversion between <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code>, we might
implement <code>Convert</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Convert&lt;usize&gt; for isize { ... } // isize -&gt; usize
impl Convert&lt;isize&gt; for usize { ... } // usize -&gt; isize
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine there is some code like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let x: isize = ...;
let y = x.convert();
</code></pre>
<p>The call to convert will generate a trait reference <code>Convert&lt;$Y&gt; for isize</code>, where <code>$Y</code> is the type variable representing the type of
<code>y</code>. Of the two impls we can see, the only one that matches is
<code>Convert&lt;usize&gt; for isize</code>. Therefore, we can
select this impl, which will cause the type of <code>$Y</code> to be unified to
<code>usize</code>. (Note that while assembling candidates, we do the initial
unifications in a transaction, so that they don't affect one another.)</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: The example says we can &quot;select&quot; the impl, but this section is
talking specifically about candidate assembly. Does this mean we can sometimes
skip confirmation? Or is this poor wording?
<strong>TODO</strong>: Is the unification of <code>$Y</code> part of trait resolution or type
inference? Or is this not the same type of &quot;inference variable&quot; as in type
inference?</p>
<a class="header" href="#winnowing-resolving-ambiguities" id="winnowing-resolving-ambiguities"><h4>Winnowing: Resolving ambiguities</h4></a>
<p>But what happens if there are multiple impls where all the types
unify? Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Get {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; Self;
}

impl&lt;T:Copy&gt; Get for T {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; T { *self }
}

impl&lt;T:Get&gt; Get for Box&lt;T&gt; {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; Box&lt;T&gt; { Box::new(get_it(&amp;**self)) }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens when we invoke <code>get_it(&amp;Box::new(1_u16))</code>, for example? In this
case, the <code>Self</code> type is <code>Box&lt;u16&gt;</code> – that unifies with both impls,
because the first applies to all types <code>T</code>, and the second to all
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. In order for this to be unambiguous, the compiler does a <em>winnowing</em>
pass that considers <code>where</code> clauses
and attempts to remove candidates. In this case, the first impl only
applies if <code>Box&lt;u16&gt; : Copy</code>, which doesn't hold. After winnowing,
then, we are left with just one candidate, so we can proceed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#where-clauses" id="where-clauses"><h4><code>where</code> clauses</h4></a>
<p>Besides an impl, the other major way to resolve an obligation is via a
where clause. The selection process is always given a <a href="../param_env.html">parameter
environment</a> which contains a list of where clauses, which are
basically obligations that we can assume are satisfiable. We will iterate
over that list and check whether our current obligation can be found
in that list. If so, it is considered satisfied. More precisely, we
want to check whether there is a where-clause obligation that is for
the same trait (or some subtrait) and which can match against the obligation.</p>
<p>Consider this simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait A1 {
    fn do_a1(&amp;self);
}
trait A2 : A1 { ... }

trait B {
    fn do_b(&amp;self);
}

fn foo&lt;X:A2+B&gt;(x: X) {
    x.do_a1(); // (*)
    x.do_b();  // (#)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the body of <code>foo</code>, clearly we can use methods of <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, or <code>B</code>
on variable <code>x</code>. The line marked <code>(*)</code> will incur an obligation <code>X: A1</code>,
while the line marked <code>(#)</code> will incur an obligation <code>X: B</code>. Meanwhile,
the parameter environment will contain two where-clauses: <code>X : A2</code> and <code>X : B</code>.
For each obligation, then, we search this list of where-clauses. The
obligation <code>X: B</code> trivially matches against the where-clause <code>X: B</code>.
To resolve an obligation <code>X:A1</code>, we would note that <code>X:A2</code> implies that <code>X:A1</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#confirmation" id="confirmation"><h3>Confirmation</h3></a>
<p><em>Confirmation</em> unifies the output type parameters of the trait with the
values found in the obligation, possibly yielding a type error.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the following variation of the <code>Convert</code> example in the
previous section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Convert&lt;Target&gt; {
    fn convert(&amp;self) -&gt; Target;
}

impl Convert&lt;usize&gt; for isize { ... } // isize -&gt; usize
impl Convert&lt;isize&gt; for usize { ... } // usize -&gt; isize

let x: isize = ...;
let y: char = x.convert(); // NOTE: `y: char` now!
</code></pre>
<p>Confirmation is where an error would be reported because the impl specified
that <code>Target</code> would be <code>usize</code>, but the obligation reported <code>char</code>. Hence the
result of selection would be an error.</p>
<p>Note that the candidate impl is chosen based on the <code>Self</code> type, but
confirmation is done based on (in this case) the <code>Target</code> type parameter.</p>
<a class="header" href="#selection-during-translation" id="selection-during-translation"><h3>Selection during translation</h3></a>
<p>As mentioned above, during type checking, we do not store the results of trait
selection. At trans time, we repeat the trait selection to choose a particular
impl for each method call. In this second selection, we do not consider any
where-clauses to be in scope because we know that each resolution will resolve
to a particular impl.</p>
<p>One interesting twist has to do with nested obligations. In general, in trans,
we only need to do a &quot;shallow&quot; selection for an obligation. That is, we wish to
identify which impl applies, but we do not (yet) need to decide how to select
any nested obligations. Nonetheless, we <em>do</em> currently do a complete resolution,
and that is because it can sometimes inform the results of type inference.
That is, we do not have the full substitutions in terms of the type variables
of the impl available to us, so we must run trait selection to figure
everything out.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: is this still talking about trans?</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo { ... }
impl&lt;U, T:Bar&lt;U&gt;&gt; Foo for Vec&lt;T&gt; { ... }

impl Bar&lt;usize&gt; for isize { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>After one shallow round of selection for an obligation like <code>Vec&lt;isize&gt; : Foo</code>, we would know which impl we want, and we would know that
<code>T=isize</code>, but we do not know the type of <code>U</code>.  We must select the
nested obligation <code>isize : Bar&lt;U&gt;</code> to find out that <code>U=usize</code>.</p>
<p>It would be good to only do <em>just as much</em> nested resolution as
necessary. Currently, though, we just do a full resolution.</p>
<a class="header" href="#higher-ranked-trait-bounds" id="higher-ranked-trait-bounds"><h1>Higher-ranked trait bounds</h1></a>
<p>One of the more subtle concepts in trait resolution is <em>higher-ranked trait
bounds</em>. An example of such a bound is <code>for&lt;'a&gt; MyTrait&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>.
Let's walk through how selection on higher-ranked trait references
works.</p>
<a class="header" href="#basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks" id="basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks"><h2>Basic matching and placeholder leaks</h2></a>
<p>Suppose we have a trait <code>Foo</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait Foo&lt;X&gt; {
    fn foo(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's say we have a function <code>want_hrtb</code> that wants a type which
implements <code>Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> for any <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn want_hrtb&lt;T&gt;() where T : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a struct <code>AnyInt</code> that implements <code>Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> for any
<code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct AnyInt;
impl&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt; for AnyInt { }
</code></pre>
<p>And the question is, does <code>AnyInt : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>? We want the
answer to be yes. The algorithm for figuring it out is closely related
to the subtyping for higher-ranked types (which is described <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc/infer/higher_ranked/README.md">here</a>
and also in a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/higher-rank/">paper by SPJ</a>. If you wish to understand higher-ranked
subtyping, we recommend you read the paper). There are a few parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace bound regions in the obligation with placeholders.</li>
<li>Match the impl against the <a href="../appendix/glossary.html#appendix-c-glossary">placeholder</a> obligation.</li>
<li>Check for <em>placeholder leaks</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let's work through our example.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first thing we would do is to
replace the bound region in the obligation with a placeholder, yielding
<code>AnyInt : Foo&lt;&amp;'0 isize&gt;</code> (here <code>'0</code> represents placeholder region #0).
Note that we now have no quantifiers;
in terms of the compiler type, this changes from a <code>ty::PolyTraitRef</code>
to a <code>TraitRef</code>. We would then create the <code>TraitRef</code> from the impl,
using fresh variables for it's bound regions (and thus getting
<code>Foo&lt;&amp;'$a isize&gt;</code>, where <code>'$a</code> is the inference variable for <code>'a</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next
we relate the two trait refs, yielding a graph with the constraint
that <code>'0 == '$a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we check for placeholder &quot;leaks&quot; – a
leak is basically any attempt to relate a placeholder region to another
placeholder region, or to any region that pre-existed the impl match.
The leak check is done by searching from the placeholder region to find
the set of regions that it is related to in any way. This is called
the &quot;taint&quot; set. To pass the check, that set must consist <em>solely</em> of
itself and region variables from the impl. If the taint set includes
any other region, then the match is a failure. In this case, the taint
set for <code>'0</code> is <code>{'0, '$a}</code>, and hence the check will succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider a failure case. Imagine we also have a struct</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct StaticInt;
impl Foo&lt;&amp;'static isize&gt; for StaticInt;
</code></pre>
<p>We want the obligation <code>StaticInt : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> to be
considered unsatisfied. The check begins just as before. <code>'a</code> is
replaced with a placeholder <code>'0</code> and the impl trait reference is instantiated to
<code>Foo&lt;&amp;'static isize&gt;</code>. When we relate those two, we get a constraint
like <code>'static == '0</code>. This means that the taint set for <code>'0</code> is <code>{'0, 'static}</code>, which fails the leak check.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: This is because <code>'static</code> is not a region variable but is in the
taint set, right?</p>
<a class="header" href="#higher-ranked-trait-obligations" id="higher-ranked-trait-obligations"><h2>Higher-ranked trait obligations</h2></a>
<p>Once the basic matching is done, we get to another interesting topic:
how to deal with impl obligations. I'll work through a simple example
here. Imagine we have the traits <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> and an associated impl:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait Foo&lt;X&gt; {
    fn foo(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}

trait Bar&lt;X&gt; {
    fn bar(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}

impl&lt;X,F&gt; Foo&lt;X&gt; for F
    where F : Bar&lt;X&gt;
{
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now let's say we have a obligation <code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> and we match
this impl. What obligation is generated as a result? We want to get
<code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Bar&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>, but how does that happen?</p>
<p>After the matching, we are in a position where we have a placeholder
substitution like <code>X =&gt; &amp;'0 isize</code>. If we apply this substitution to the
impl obligations, we get <code>F : Bar&lt;&amp;'0 isize&gt;</code>. Obviously this is not
directly usable because the placeholder region <code>'0</code> cannot leak out of
our computation.</p>
<p>What we do is to create an inverse mapping from the taint set of <code>'0</code>
back to the original bound region (<code>'a</code>, here) that <code>'0</code> resulted
from. (This is done in <code>higher_ranked::plug_leaks</code>). We know that the
leak check passed, so this taint set consists solely of the placeholder
region itself plus various intermediate region variables. We then walk
the trait-reference and convert every region in that taint set back to
a late-bound region, so in this case we'd wind up with
<code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Bar&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#caching-and-subtle-considerations-therewith" id="caching-and-subtle-considerations-therewith"><h1>Caching and subtle considerations therewith</h1></a>
<p>In general, we attempt to cache the results of trait selection.  This
is a somewhat complex process. Part of the reason for this is that we
want to be able to cache results even when all the types in the trait
reference are not fully known. In that case, it may happen that the
trait selection process is also influencing type variables, so we have
to be able to not only cache the <em>result</em> of the selection process,
but <em>replay</em> its effects on the type variables.</p>
<a class="header" href="#an-example" id="an-example"><h2>An example</h2></a>
<p>The high-level idea of how the cache works is that we first replace
all unbound inference variables with placeholder versions. Therefore,
if we had a trait reference <code>usize : Foo&lt;$t&gt;</code>, where <code>$t</code> is an unbound
inference variable, we might replace it with <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt;</code>, where
<code>$0</code> is a placeholder type. We would then look this up in the cache.</p>
<p>If we found a hit, the hit would tell us the immediate next step to
take in the selection process (e.g. apply impl #22, or apply where
clause <code>X : Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there is no hit, we need to go through the <a href="./resolution.html#selection">selection
process</a> from scratch. Suppose, we come to the conclusion that the only
possible impl is this one, with def-id 22:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Foo&lt;isize&gt; for usize { ... } // Impl #22
</code></pre>
<p>We would then record in the cache <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt; =&gt; ImplCandidate(22)</code>. Next
we would <a href="./resolution.html#confirmation">confirm</a> <code>ImplCandidate(22)</code>, which would (as a side-effect) unify
<code>$t</code> with <code>isize</code>.</p>
<p>Now, at some later time, we might come along and see a <code>usize : Foo&lt;$u&gt;</code>. When replaced with a placeholder, this would yield <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt;</code>, just as
before, and hence the cache lookup would succeed, yielding
<code>ImplCandidate(22)</code>. We would confirm <code>ImplCandidate(22)</code> which would
(as a side-effect) unify <code>$u</code> with <code>isize</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#where-clauses-and-the-local-vs-global-cache" id="where-clauses-and-the-local-vs-global-cache"><h2>Where clauses and the local vs global cache</h2></a>
<p>One subtle interaction is that the results of trait lookup will vary
depending on what where clauses are in scope. Therefore, we actually
have <em>two</em> caches, a local and a global cache. The local cache is
attached to the <a href="../param_env.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a>, and the global cache attached to the
<a href="../ty.html"><code>tcx</code></a>. We use the local cache whenever the result might depend on the
where clauses that are in scope. The determination of which cache to
use is done by the method <code>pick_candidate_cache</code> in <code>select.rs</code>. At
the moment, we use a very simple, conservative rule: if there are any
where-clauses in scope, then we use the local cache.  We used to try
and draw finer-grained distinctions, but that led to a serious of
annoying and weird bugs like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22019">#22019</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18290">#18290</a>. This simple rule seems
to be pretty clearly safe and also still retains a very high hit rate
(~95% when compiling rustc).</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: it looks like <code>pick_candidate_cache</code> no longer exists. In
general, is this section still accurate at all?</p>
<a class="header" href="#specialization" id="specialization"><h1>Specialization</h1></a>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: where does Chalk fit in? Should we mention/discuss it here?</p>
<p>Defined in the <code>specialize</code> module.</p>
<p>The basic strategy is to build up a <em>specialization graph</em> during
coherence checking (recall that coherence checking looks for overlapping
impls). Insertion into the graph locates the right place
to put an impl in the specialization hierarchy; if there is no right
place (due to partial overlap but no containment), you get an overlap
error. Specialization is consulted when selecting an impl (of course),
and the graph is consulted when propagating defaults down the
specialization hierarchy.</p>
<p>You might expect that the specialization graph would be used during
selection – i.e. when actually performing specialization. This is
not done for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's merely an optimization: given a set of candidates that apply,
we can determine the most specialized one by comparing them directly
for specialization, rather than consulting the graph. Given that we
also cache the results of selection, the benefit of this
optimization is questionable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build the specialization graph in the first place, we need to use
selection (because we need to determine whether one impl specializes
another). Dealing with this reentrancy would require some additional
mode switch for selection. Given that there seems to be no strong
reason to use the graph anyway, we stick with a simpler approach in
selection, and use the graph only for propagating default
implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trait impl selection can succeed even when multiple impls can apply,
as long as they are part of the same specialization family. In that
case, it returns a <em>single</em> impl on success – this is the most
specialized impl <em>known</em> to apply. However, if there are any inference
variables in play, the returned impl may not be the actual impl we
will use at trans time. Thus, we take special care to avoid projecting
associated types unless either (1) the associated type does not use
<code>default</code> and thus cannot be overridden or (2) all input types are
known concretely.</p>

<a class="header" href="#ongoing-work" id="ongoing-work"><h2>Ongoing work</h2></a>
<p>The design of the new-style trait solving currently happens in two places:</p>
<p><strong>chalk</strong>. The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk">chalk</a> repository is where we experiment with new ideas
and designs for the trait system. It primarily consists of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a unit testing framework
for the correctness and feasibility of the logical rules defining the
new-style trait system.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk/tree/master/chalk-engine"><code>chalk_engine</code></a> crate, which
defines the new-style trait solver used both in the unit testing framework
and in rustc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>rustc</strong>. Once we are happy with the logical rules, we proceed to
implementing them in rustc. This mainly happens in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_traits"><code>librustc_traits</code></a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-to-logic" id="lowering-to-logic"><h1>Lowering to logic</h1></a>
<p>The key observation here is that the Rust trait system is basically a
kind of logic, and it can be mapped onto standard logical inference
rules. We can then look for solutions to those inference rules in a
very similar fashion to how e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> solver works. It turns out
that we can't <em>quite</em> use Prolog rules (also called Horn clauses) but
rather need a somewhat more expressive variant.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rust-traits-and-logic" id="rust-traits-and-logic"><h2>Rust traits and logic</h2></a>
<p>One of the first observations is that the Rust trait system is
basically a kind of logic. As such, we can map our struct, trait, and
impl declarations into logical inference rules. For the most part,
these are basically Horn clauses, though we'll see that to capture the
full richness of Rust – and in particular to support generic
programming – we have to go a bit further than standard Horn clauses.</p>
<p>To see how this mapping works, let's start with an example. Imagine
we declare a trait and a few impls, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait Clone { }
impl Clone for usize { }
impl&lt;T&gt; Clone for Vec&lt;T&gt; where T: Clone { }
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>We could map these declarations to some Horn clauses, written in a
Prolog-like notation, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Clone(usize).
Clone(Vec&lt;?T&gt;) :- Clone(?T).

// The notation `A :- B` means &quot;A is true if B is true&quot;.
// Or, put another way, B implies A.
</code></pre>
<p>In Prolog terms, we might say that <code>Clone(Foo)</code> – where <code>Foo</code> is some
Rust type – is a <em>predicate</em> that represents the idea that the type
<code>Foo</code> implements <code>Clone</code>. These rules are <strong>program clauses</strong>; they
state the conditions under which that predicate can be proven (i.e.,
considered true). So the first rule just says &quot;Clone is implemented
for <code>usize</code>&quot;. The next rule says &quot;for any type <code>?T</code>, Clone is
implemented for <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code> if clone is implemented for <code>?T</code>&quot;. So
e.g. if we wanted to prove that <code>Clone(Vec&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;)</code>, we would do
so by applying the rules recursively:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;usize&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(usize)</code> is provable. (Which it is, so we're all good.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But now suppose we tried to prove that <code>Clone(Vec&lt;Bar&gt;)</code>. This would
fail (after all, I didn't give an impl of <code>Clone</code> for <code>Bar</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;Bar&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Bar)</code> is provable. (But it is not, as there are no applicable rules.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can easily extend the example above to cover generic traits with
more than one input type. So imagine the <code>Eq&lt;T&gt;</code> trait, which declares
that <code>Self</code> is equatable with a value of type <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Eq&lt;T&gt; { ... }
impl Eq&lt;usize&gt; for usize { }
impl&lt;T: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt; Eq&lt;Vec&lt;U&gt;&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; { }
</code></pre>
<p>That could be mapped as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Eq(usize, usize).
Eq(Vec&lt;?T&gt;, Vec&lt;?U&gt;) :- Eq(?T, ?U).
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<a class="header" href="#type-checking-normal-functions" id="type-checking-normal-functions"><h2>Type-checking normal functions</h2></a>
<p>OK, now that we have defined some logical rules that are able to
express when traits are implemented and to handle associated types,
let's turn our focus a bit towards <strong>type-checking</strong>. Type-checking is
interesting because it is what gives us the goals that we need to
prove. That is, everything we've seen so far has been about how we
derive the rules by which we can prove goals from the traits and impls
in the program; but we are also interested in how to derive the goals
that we need to prove, and those come from type-checking.</p>
<p>Consider type-checking the function <code>foo()</code> here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() { bar::&lt;usize&gt;() }
fn bar&lt;U: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt;() { }
</code></pre>
<p>This function is very simple, of course: all it does is to call
<code>bar::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>. Now, looking at the definition of <code>bar()</code>, we can see
that it has one where-clause <code>U: Eq&lt;U&gt;</code>. So, that means that <code>foo()</code> will
have to prove that <code>usize: Eq&lt;usize&gt;</code> in order to show that it can call <code>bar()</code>
with <code>usize</code> as the type argument.</p>
<p>If we wanted, we could write a Prolog predicate that defines the
conditions under which <code>bar()</code> can be called. We'll say that those
conditions are called being &quot;well-formed&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">barWellFormed(?U) :- Eq(?U, ?U).
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can say that <code>foo()</code> type-checks if the reference to
<code>bar::&lt;usize&gt;</code> (that is, <code>bar()</code> applied to the type <code>usize</code>) is
well-formed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fooTypeChecks :- barWellFormed(usize).
</code></pre>
<p>If we try to prove the goal <code>fooTypeChecks</code>, it will succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fooTypeChecks</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>barWellFormed(usize)</code>, which is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Eq(usize, usize)</code>, which is provable because of an impl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so far so good. Let's move on to type-checking a more complex function.</p>
<a class="header" href="#type-checking-generic-functions-beyond-horn-clauses" id="type-checking-generic-functions-beyond-horn-clauses"><h2>Type-checking generic functions: beyond Horn clauses</h2></a>
<p>In the last section, we used standard Prolog horn-clauses (augmented with Rust's
notion of type equality) to type-check some simple Rust functions. But that only
works when we are type-checking non-generic functions. If we want to type-check
a generic function, it turns out we need a stronger notion of goal than what Prolog
can provide. To see what I'm talking about, let's revamp our previous
example to make <code>foo</code> generic:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T: Eq&lt;T&gt;&gt;() { bar::&lt;T&gt;() }
fn bar&lt;U: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt;() { }
</code></pre>
<p>To type-check the body of <code>foo</code>, we need to be able to hold the type
<code>T</code> &quot;abstract&quot;.  That is, we need to check that the body of <code>foo</code> is
type-safe <em>for all types <code>T</code></em>, not just for some specific type. We might express
this like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fooTypeChecks :-
  // for all types T...
  forall&lt;T&gt; {
    // ...if we assume that Eq(T, T) is provable...
    if (Eq(T, T)) {
      // ...then we can prove that `barWellFormed(T)` holds.
      barWellFormed(T)
    }
  }.
</code></pre>
<p>This notation I'm using here is the notation I've been using in my
prototype implementation; it's similar to standard mathematical
notation but a bit Rustified. Anyway, the problem is that standard
Horn clauses don't allow universal quantification (<code>forall</code>) or
implication (<code>if</code>) in goals (though many Prolog engines do support
them, as an extension). For this reason, we need to accept something
called &quot;first-order hereditary harrop&quot; (FOHH) clauses – this long
name basically means &quot;standard Horn clauses with <code>forall</code> and <code>if</code> in
the body&quot;. But it's nice to know the proper name, because there is a
lot of work describing how to efficiently handle FOHH clauses; see for
example Gopalan Nadathur's excellent
<a href="./bibliography.html#pphhf">&quot;A Proof Procedure for the Logic of Hereditary Harrop Formulas&quot;</a>
in <a href="./bibliography.html">the bibliography</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that supporting FOHH is not really all that hard. And
once we are able to do that, we can easily describe the type-checking
rule for generic functions like <code>foo</code> in our logic.</p>

<p>This page is a lightly adapted version of a
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2017/01/26/lowering-rust-traits-to-logic/">blog post by Nicholas Matsakis</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#goals-and-clauses" id="goals-and-clauses"><h1>Goals and clauses</h1></a>
<p>In logic programming terms, a <strong>goal</strong> is something that you must
prove and a <strong>clause</strong> is something that you know is true. As
described in the <a href="./lowering-to-logic.html">lowering to logic</a>
chapter, Rust's trait solver is based on an extension of hereditary
harrop (HH) clauses, which extend traditional Prolog Horn clauses with
a few new superpowers.</p>
<a class="header" href="#goals-and-clauses-meta-structure" id="goals-and-clauses-meta-structure"><h2>Goals and clauses meta structure</h2></a>
<p>In Rust's solver, <strong>goals</strong> and <strong>clauses</strong> have the following forms
(note that the two definitions reference one another):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Goal = DomainGoal           // defined in the section below
        | Goal &amp;&amp; Goal
        | Goal || Goal
        | exists&lt;K&gt; { Goal }   // existential quantification
        | forall&lt;K&gt; { Goal }   // universal quantification
        | if (Clause) { Goal } // implication
        | true                 // something that's trivially true
        | ambiguous            // something that's never provable

Clause = DomainGoal
        | Clause :- Goal     // if can prove Goal, then Clause is true
        | Clause &amp;&amp; Clause
        | forall&lt;K&gt; { Clause }

K = &lt;type&gt;     // a &quot;kind&quot;
    | &lt;lifetime&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The proof procedure for these sorts of goals is actually quite
straightforward.  Essentially, it's a form of depth-first search. The
paper
<a href="./bibliography.html#pphhf">&quot;A Proof Procedure for the Logic of Hereditary Harrop Formulas&quot;</a>
gives the details.</p>
<p>In terms of code, these types are defined in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/traits/mod.rs"><code>librustc/traits/mod.rs</code></a> in rustc, and in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk/blob/master/chalk-ir/src/lib.rs"><code>chalk-ir/src/lib.rs</code></a> in chalk.</p>
<p><a name="domain-goals"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#domain-goals" id="domain-goals"><h2>Domain goals</h2></a>
<p><em>Domain goals</em> are the atoms of the trait logic. As can be seen in the
definitions given above, general goals basically consist in a combination of
domain goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, flattenning a bit the definition of clauses given previously, one can
see that clauses are always of the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;K1, ..., Kn&gt; { DomainGoal :- Goal }
</code></pre>
<p>hence domain goals are in fact clauses' LHS. That is, at the most granular level,
domain goals are what the trait solver will end up trying to prove.</p>
<p><a name="trait-ref"></a></p>
<p>To define the set of domain goals in our system, we need to first
introduce a few simple formulations. A <strong>trait reference</strong> consists of
the name of a trait along with a suitable set of inputs P0..Pn:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">TraitRef = P0: TraitName&lt;P1..Pn&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, for example, <code>u32: Display</code> is a trait reference, as is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator</code>. Note that Rust surface syntax also permits some extra
things, like associated type bindings (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator&lt;Item = T&gt;</code>), that are not part of a trait reference.</p>
<p><a name="projection"></a></p>
<p>A <strong>projection</strong> consists of an associated item reference along with
its inputs P0..Pm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Projection = &lt;P0 as TraitName&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocItem&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Given these, we can define a <code>DomainGoal</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">DomainGoal = Holds(WhereClause)
            | FromEnv(TraitRef)
            | FromEnv(Type)
            | WellFormed(TraitRef)
            | WellFormed(Type)
            | Normalize(Projection -&gt; Type)

WhereClause = Implemented(TraitRef)
            | ProjectionEq(Projection = Type)
            | Outlives(Type: Region)
            | Outlives(Region: Region)
</code></pre>
<p><code>WhereClause</code> refers to a <code>where</code> clause that a Rust user would actually be able
to write in a Rust program. This abstraction exists only as a convenience as we
sometimes want to only deal with domain goals that are effectively writable in
Rust.</p>
<p>Let's break down each one of these, one-by-one.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implementedtraitref" id="implementedtraitref"><h4>Implemented(TraitRef)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>Implemented(i32: Copy)</code></p>
<p>True if the given trait is implemented for the given input types and lifetimes.</p>
<a class="header" href="#projectioneqprojection--type" id="projectioneqprojection--type"><h4>ProjectionEq(Projection = Type)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>ProjectionEq&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item = u8</code></p>
<p>The given associated type <code>Projection</code> is equal to <code>Type</code>; this can be proved
with either normalization or using placeholder associated types. See
<a href="./associated-types.html">the section on associated types</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#normalizeprojection---type" id="normalizeprojection---type"><h4>Normalize(Projection -&gt; Type)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>ProjectionEq&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item -&gt; u8</code></p>
<p>The given associated type <code>Projection</code> can be <a href="./associated-types.html#normalize">normalized</a> to <code>Type</code>.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="./associated-types.html">the section on associated
types</a>, <code>Normalize</code> implies <code>ProjectionEq</code>,
but not vice versa. In general, proving <code>Normalize(&lt;T as Trait&gt;::Item -&gt; U)</code>
also requires proving <code>Implemented(T: Trait)</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#fromenvtraitref" id="fromenvtraitref"><h4>FromEnv(TraitRef)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>FromEnv(Self: Add&lt;i32&gt;)</code></p>
<p>True if the inner <code>TraitRef</code> is <em>assumed</em> to be true,
that is, if it can be derived from the in-scope where clauses.</p>
<p>For example, given the following function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn loud_clone&lt;T: Clone&gt;(stuff: &amp;T) -&gt; T {
    println!(&quot;cloning!&quot;);
    stuff.clone()
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Inside the body of our function, we would have <code>FromEnv(T: Clone)</code>. In-scope
where clauses nest, so a function body inside an impl body inherits the
impl body's where clauses, too.</p>
<p>This and the next rule are used to implement <a href="./lowering-rules.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>. As we'll see
in the section on lowering, <code>FromEnv(TraitRef)</code> implies <code>Implemented(TraitRef)</code>,
but not vice versa. This distinction is crucial to implied bounds.</p>
<a class="header" href="#fromenvtype" id="fromenvtype"><h4>FromEnv(Type)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code></p>
<p>True if the inner <code>Type</code> is <em>assumed</em> to be well-formed, that is, if it is an
input type of a function or an impl.</p>
<p>For example, given the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct HashSet&lt;K&gt; where K: Hash { ... }

fn loud_insert&lt;K&gt;(set: &amp;mut HashSet&lt;K&gt;, item: K) {
    println!(&quot;inserting!&quot;);
    set.insert(item);
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> is an input type of the <code>loud_insert</code> function. Hence, we assume it
to be well-formed, so we would have <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> inside the body of our
function. As we'll see in the section on lowering, <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> implies
<code>Implemented(K: Hash)</code> because the
<code>HashSet</code> declaration was written with a <code>K: Hash</code> where clause. Hence, we don't
need to repeat that bound on the <code>loud_insert</code> function: we rather automatically
assume that it is true.</p>
<a class="header" href="#wellformeditem" id="wellformeditem"><h4>WellFormed(Item)</h4></a>
<p>These goals imply that the given item is <em>well-formed</em>.</p>
<p>We can talk about different types of items being well-formed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Types</em>, like <code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;i32&gt;)</code>, which is true in Rust, or
<code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;str&gt;)</code>, which is not (because <code>str</code> is not <code>Sized</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>TraitRefs</em>, like <code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well-formedness is important to <a href="./lowering-rules.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>. In particular, the reason
it is okay to assume <code>FromEnv(T: Clone)</code> in the <code>loud_clone</code> example is that we
<em>also</em> verify <code>WellFormed(T: Clone)</code> for each call site of <code>loud_clone</code>.
Similarly, it is okay to assume <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> in the <code>loud_insert</code>
example because we will verify <code>WellFormed(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> for each call site of
<code>loud_insert</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#outlivestype-region-outlivesregion-region" id="outlivestype-region-outlivesregion-region"><h4>Outlives(Type: Region), Outlives(Region: Region)</h4></a>
<p>e.g. <code>Outlives(&amp;'a str: 'b)</code>, <code>Outlives('a: 'static)</code></p>
<p>True if the given type or region on the left outlives the right-hand region.</p>
<p><a name="coinductive"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#coinductive-goals" id="coinductive-goals"><h2>Coinductive goals</h2></a>
<p>Most goals in our system are &quot;inductive&quot;. In an inductive goal,
circular reasoning is disallowed. Consider this example clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Implemented(Foo: Bar) :-
        Implemented(Foo: Bar).
</code></pre>
<p>Considered inductively, this clause is useless: if we are trying to
prove <code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code>, we would then recursively have to prove
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code>, and that cycle would continue ad infinitum
(the trait solver will terminate here, it would just consider that
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code> is not known to be true).</p>
<p>However, some goals are <em>co-inductive</em>. Simply put, this means that
cycles are OK. So, if <code>Bar</code> were a co-inductive trait, then the rule
above would be perfectly valid, and it would indicate that
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code> is true.</p>
<p><em>Auto traits</em> are one example in Rust where co-inductive goals are used.
Consider the <code>Send</code> trait, and imagine that we have this struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct Foo {
    next: Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The default rules for auto traits say that <code>Foo</code> is <code>Send</code> if the
types of its fields are <code>Send</code>. Therefore, we would have a rule like</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Implemented(Foo: Send) :-
    Implemented(Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;: Send).
</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably imagine, proving that <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;: Send</code> is
going to wind up circularly requiring us to prove that <code>Foo: Send</code>
again. So this would be an example where we wind up in a cycle – but
that's ok, we <em>do</em> consider <code>Foo: Send</code> to hold, even though it
references itself.</p>
<p>In general, co-inductive traits are used in Rust trait solving when we
want to enumerate a fixed set of possibilities. In the case of auto
traits, we are enumerating the set of reachable types from a given
starting point (i.e., <code>Foo</code> can reach values of type
<code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;</code>, which implies it can reach values of type
<code>Box&lt;Foo&gt;</code>, and then of type <code>Foo</code>, and then the cycle is complete).</p>
<p>In addition to auto traits, <code>WellFormed</code> predicates are co-inductive.
These are used to achieve a similar &quot;enumerate all the cases&quot; pattern,
as described in the section on <a href="./lowering-rules.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>.</p>

</ul>
<a class="header" href="#equality-and-associated-types" id="equality-and-associated-types"><h1>Equality and associated types</h1></a>
<p>This section covers how the trait system handles equality between
associated types. The full system consists of several moving parts,
which we will introduce one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projection and the <code>Normalize</code> predicate</li>
<li>Placeholder associated type projections</li>
<li>The <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate</li>
<li>Integration with unification</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#associated-type-projection-and-normalization" id="associated-type-projection-and-normalization"><h2>Associated type projection and normalization</h2></a>
<p>When a trait defines an associated type (e.g.,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html#associatedtype.Item">the <code>Item</code> type in the <code>IntoIterator</code> trait</a>), that
type can be referenced by the user using an <strong>associated type
projection</strong> like <code>&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Often, people will use the shorthand syntax <code>T::Item</code>. Presently, that
syntax is expanded during <a href="../type-checking.html">&quot;type collection&quot;</a> into the
explicit form, though that is something we may want to change in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="normalize"></a></p>
<p>In some cases, associated type projections can be <strong>normalized</strong> –
that is, simplified – based on the types given in an impl. So, to
continue with our example, the impl of <code>IntoIterator</code> for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
declares (among other things) that <code>Item = T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T&gt; IntoIterator for Option&lt;T&gt; {
  type Item = T;
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means we can normalize the projection <code>&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code> to just <code>u32</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, the projection was a &quot;monomorphic&quot; one – that is, it
did not have any type parameters.  Monomorphic projections are special
because they can <strong>always</strong> be fully normalized.</p>
<p>Often, we can normalize other associated type projections as well. For
example, <code>&lt;Option&lt;?T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code>, where <code>?T</code> is an inference
variable, can be normalized to just <code>?T</code>.</p>
<p>In our logic, normalization is defined by a predicate
<code>Normalize</code>. The <code>Normalize</code> clauses arise only from
impls. For example, the <code>impl</code> of <code>IntoIterator</code> for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> that
we saw above would be lowered to a program clause like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;T&gt; {
    Normalize(&lt;Option&lt;T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item -&gt; T) :-
        Implemented(Option&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator)
}
</code></pre>
<p>where in this case, the one <code>Implemented</code> condition is always true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we do not permit quantification over traits, this is really more like
a family of program clauses, one for each associated type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could apply that rule to normalize either of the examples that
we've seen so far.</p>
<a class="header" href="#placeholder-associated-types" id="placeholder-associated-types"><h2>Placeholder associated types</h2></a>
<p>Sometimes however we want to work with associated types that cannot be
normalized. For example, consider this function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T: IntoIterator&gt;(...) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>In this context, how would we normalize the type <code>T::Item</code>?</p>
<p>Without knowing what <code>T</code> is, we can't really do so. To represent this case,
we introduce a type called a <strong>placeholder associated type projection</strong>. This
is written like so: <code>(IntoIterator::Item)&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You may note that it looks a lot like a regular type (e.g., <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>),
except that the &quot;name&quot; of the type is <code>(IntoIterator::Item)</code>. This is not an
accident: placeholder associated type projections work just like ordinary
types like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> when it comes to unification. That is, they are only
considered equal if (a) they are both references to the same associated type,
like <code>IntoIterator::Item</code> and (b) their type arguments are equal.</p>
<p>Placeholder associated types are never written directly by the user.
They are used internally by the trait system only, as we will see
shortly.</p>
<p>In rustc, they correspond to the <code>TyKind::UnnormalizedProjectionTy</code> enum
variant, declared in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/ty/sty.rs"><code>librustc/ty/sty.rs</code></a>. In chalk, we use an
<code>ApplicationTy</code> with a name living in a special namespace dedicated to
placeholder associated types (see the <code>TypeName</code> enum declared in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk/blob/master/chalk-ir/src/lib.rs"><code>chalk-ir/src/lib.rs</code></a>).</p>
<a class="header" href="#projection-equality" id="projection-equality"><h2>Projection equality</h2></a>
<p>So far we have seen two ways to answer the question of &quot;When can we
consider an associated type projection equal to another type?&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>Normalize</code> predicate could be used to transform projections when we
knew which impl applied;</li>
<li><strong>placeholder</strong> associated types can be used when we don't. This is also
known as <strong>lazy normalization</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We now introduce the <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate to bring those two cases
together. The <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate looks like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = U)
</code></pre>
<p>and we will see that it can be proven <em>either</em> via normalization or
via the placeholder type. As part of lowering an associated type declaration from
some trait, we create two program clauses for <code>ProjectionEq</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;T, U&gt; {
    ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = U) :-
        Normalize(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item -&gt; U)
}

forall&lt;T&gt; {
    ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = (IntoIterator::Item)&lt;T&gt;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>These are the only two <code>ProjectionEq</code> program clauses we ever make for
any given associated item.</p>
<a class="header" href="#integration-with-unification" id="integration-with-unification"><h2>Integration with unification</h2></a>
<p>Now we are ready to discuss how associated type equality integrates
with unification. As described in the
<a href="../type-inference.html">type inference</a> section, unification is
basically a procedure with a signature like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Unify(A, B) = Result&lt;(Subgoals, RegionConstraints), NoSolution&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, we try to unify two things A and B. That procedure
might just fail, in which case we get back <code>Err(NoSolution)</code>. This
would happen, for example, if we tried to unify <code>u32</code> and <code>i32</code>.</p>
<p>The key point is that, on success, unification can also give back to
us a set of subgoals that still remain to be proven. (It can also give
back region constraints, but those are not relevant here).</p>
<p>Whenever unification encounters a non-placeholder associated type
projection P being equated with some other type T, it always succeeds,
but it produces a subgoal <code>ProjectionEq(P = T)</code> that is propagated
back up. Thus it falls to the ordinary workings of the trait system
to process that constraint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we unify two projections P1 and P2, then unification produces a
variable X and asks us to prove that <code>ProjectionEq(P1 = X)</code> and
<code>ProjectionEq(P2 = X)</code>. (That used to be needed in an older system to
prevent cycles; I rather doubt it still is. -nmatsakis)</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds" id="implied-bounds"><h1>Implied Bounds</h1></a>
<p>Implied bounds remove the need to repeat where clauses written on
a type declaration or a trait declaration. For example, say we have the
following type declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct HashSet&lt;K: Hash&gt; {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>then everywhere we use <code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> as an &quot;input&quot; type, that is appearing in
the receiver type of an <code>impl</code> or in the arguments of a function, we don't
want to have to repeat the <code>where K: Hash</code> bound, as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// I don't want to have to repeat `where K: Hash` here.
impl&lt;K&gt; HashSet&lt;K&gt; {
    ...
}

// Same here.
fn loud_insert&lt;K&gt;(set: &amp;mut HashSet&lt;K&gt;, item: K) {
    println!(&quot;inserting!&quot;);
    set.insert(item);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the <code>loud_insert</code> example, <code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> is not the type
of the <code>set</code> argument of <code>loud_insert</code>, it only <em>appears</em> in the
argument type <code>&amp;mut HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code>: we care about every type appearing
in the function's header (the header is the signature without the return type),
not only types of the function's arguments.</p>
<p>The rationale for applying implied bounds to input types is that, for example,
in order to call the <code>loud_insert</code> function above, the programmer must have
<em>produced</em> the type <code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> already, hence the compiler already verified
that <code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> was well-formed, i.e. that <code>K</code> effectively implemented
<code>Hash</code>, as in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    // I am producing a value of type `HashSet&lt;i32&gt;`.
    // If `i32` was not `Hash`, the compiler would report an error here.
    let set: HashSet&lt;i32&gt; = HashSet::new();
    loud_insert(&amp;mut set, 5);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hence, we don't want to repeat where clauses for input types because that would
sort of duplicate the work of the programmer, having to verify that their types
are well-formed both when calling the function and when using them in the
arguments of their function. The same reasoning applies when using an <code>impl</code>.</p>
<p>Similarly, given the following trait declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Copy where Self: Clone { // desugared version of `Copy: Clone`
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>then everywhere we bound over <code>SomeType: Copy</code>, we would like to be able to
use the fact that <code>SomeType: Clone</code> without having to write it explicitly,
as in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn loud_clone&lt;T: Clone&gt;(x: T) {
    println!(&quot;cloning!&quot;);
    x.clone();
}

fn fun_with_copy&lt;T: Copy&gt;(x: T) {
    println!(&quot;will clone a `Copy` type soon...&quot;);

    // I'm using `loud_clone&lt;T: Clone&gt;` with `T: Copy`, I know this
    // implies `T: Clone` so I don't want to have to write it explicitly.
    loud_clone(x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The rationale for implied bounds for traits is that if a type implements
<code>Copy</code>, that is, if there exists an <code>impl Copy</code> for that type, there <em>ought</em>
to exist an <code>impl Clone</code> for that type, otherwise the compiler would have
reported an error in the first place. So again, if we were forced to repeat the
additionnal <code>where SomeType: Clone</code> everywhere whereas we already know that
<code>SomeType: Copy</code> hold, we would kind of duplicate the verification work.</p>
<p>Implied bounds are not yet completely enforced in rustc, at the moment it only
works for outlive requirements, super trait bounds, and bounds on associated
types. The full RFC can be found <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2089-implied-bounds.md">here</a>. We'll give here a brief view
of how implied bounds work and why we chose to implement it that way. The
complete set of lowering rules can be found in the corresponding
<a href="traits/./lowering-rules.html">chapter</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds-and-lowering-rules" id="implied-bounds-and-lowering-rules"><h2>Implied bounds and lowering rules</h2></a>
<p>Now we need to express implied bounds in terms of logical rules. We will start
with exposing a naive way to do it. Suppose that we have the following traits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo {
    ...
}

trait Bar where Self: Foo { } {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>So we would like to say that if a type implements <code>Bar</code>, then necessarily
it must also implement <code>Foo</code>. We might think that a clause like this would
work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;Type&gt; {
    Implemented(Type: Foo) :- Implemented(Type: Bar).
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose that we just write this impl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct X;

impl Bar for X { }
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly this should not be allowed: indeed, we wrote a <code>Bar</code> impl for <code>X</code>, but
the <code>Bar</code> trait requires that we also implement <code>Foo</code> for <code>X</code>, which we never
did. In terms of what the compiler does, this would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct X;

impl Bar for X {
    // We are in a `Bar` impl for the type `X`.
    // There is a `where Self: Foo` bound on the `Bar` trait declaration.
    // Hence I need to prove that `X` also implements `Foo` for that impl
    // to be legal.
}
</code></pre>
<p>So the compiler would try to prove <code>Implemented(X: Foo)</code>. Of course it will
not find any <code>impl Foo for X</code> since we did not write any. However, it
will see our implied bound clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;Type&gt; {
    Implemented(Type: Foo) :- Implemented(Type: Bar).
}
</code></pre>
<p>so that it may be able to prove <code>Implemented(X: Foo)</code> if <code>Implemented(X: Bar)</code>
holds. And it turns out that <code>Implemented(X: Bar)</code> does hold since we wrote
a <code>Bar</code> impl for <code>X</code>! Hence the compiler will accept the <code>Bar</code> impl while it
should not.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds-coming-from-the-environment" id="implied-bounds-coming-from-the-environment"><h2>Implied bounds coming from the environment</h2></a>
<p>So the naive approach does not work. What we need to do is to somehow decouple
implied bounds from impls. Suppose we know that a type <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>
implements <code>Bar</code> and we want to deduce that <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code> must also implement
<code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities: first, we have enough information about
<code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code> to see that there exists a <code>Bar</code> impl in the program which
covers <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>, for example a plain <code>impl&lt;...&gt; Bar for SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>.
Then if the compiler has done its job correctly, there <em>must</em> exist a <code>Foo</code>
impl which covers <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>, e.g. another plain
<code>impl&lt;...&gt; Foo for SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>. In that case then, we can just use this
impl and we do not need implied bounds at all.</p>
<p>Second possibility: we do not know enough about <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code> in order to
find a <code>Bar</code> impl which covers it, for example if <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code> is just
a type parameter in a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T: Bar&gt;() {
    // We'd like to deduce `Implemented(T: Foo)`.
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is, the information that <code>T</code> implements <code>Bar</code> here comes from the
<em>environment</em>. The environment is the set of things that we assume to be true
when we type check some Rust declaration. In that case, what we assume is that
<code>T: Bar</code>. Then at that point, we might authorize ourselves to have some kind
of  &quot;local&quot; implied bound reasoning which would say
<code>Implemented(T: Foo) :- Implemented(T: Bar)</code>. This reasoning would
only be done within our <code>foo</code> function in order to avoid the earlier
problem where we had a global clause.</p>
<p>We can apply these local reasonings everywhere we can have an environment
-- i.e. when we can write where clauses -- that is, inside impls,
trait declarations, and type declarations.</p>
<a class="header" href="#computing-implied-bounds-with-fromenv" id="computing-implied-bounds-with-fromenv"><h2>Computing implied bounds with <code>FromEnv</code></h2></a>
<p>The previous subsection showed that it was only useful to compute implied
bounds for facts coming from the environment.
We talked about &quot;local&quot; rules, but there are multiple possible strategies to
indeed implement the locality of implied bounds.</p>
<p>In rustc, the current strategy is to <em>elaborate</em> bounds: that is, each time
we have a fact in the environment, we recursively derive all the other things
that are implied by this fact until we reach a fixed point. For example, if
we have the following declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait A { }
trait B where Self: A { }
trait C where Self: B { }

fn foo&lt;T: C&gt;() {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>then inside the <code>foo</code> function, we start with an environment containing only
<code>Implemented(T: C)</code>. Then because of implied bounds for the <code>C</code> trait, we
elaborate <code>Implemented(T: B)</code> and add it to our environment. Because of
implied bounds for the <code>B</code> trait, we elaborate <code>Implemented(T: A)</code>and add it
to our environment as well. We cannot elaborate anything else, so we conclude
that our final environment consists of <code>Implemented(T: A + B + C)</code>.</p>
<p>In the new-style trait system, we like to encode as many things as possible
with logical rules. So rather than &quot;elaborating&quot;, we have a set of <em>global</em>
program clauses defined like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;T&gt; { Implemented(T: A) :- FromEnv(T: A). }

forall&lt;T&gt; { Implemented(T: B) :- FromEnv(T: B). }
forall&lt;T&gt; { FromEnv(T: A) :- FromEnv(T: B). }

forall&lt;T&gt; { Implemented(T: C) :- FromEnv(T: C). }
forall&lt;T&gt; { FromEnv(T: C) :- FromEnv(T: C). }
</code></pre>
<p>So these clauses are defined globally (that is, they are available from
everywhere in the program) but they cannot be used because the hypothesis
is always of the form <code>FromEnv(...)</code> which is a bit special. Indeed, as
indicated by the name, <code>FromEnv(...)</code> facts can <strong>only</strong> come from the
environment.
How it works is that in the <code>foo</code> function, instead of having an environment
containing <code>Implemented(T: C)</code>, we replace this environment with
<code>FromEnv(T: C)</code>. From here and thanks to the above clauses, we see that we
are able to reach any of <code>Implemented(T: A)</code>, <code>Implemented(T: B)</code> or
<code>Implemented(T: C)</code>, which is what we wanted.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds-and-well-formedness-checking" id="implied-bounds-and-well-formedness-checking"><h2>Implied bounds and well-formedness checking</h2></a>
<p>Implied bounds are tightly related with well-formedness checking.
Well-formedness checking is the process of checking that the impls the
programmer wrote are legal, what we referred to earlier as &quot;the compiler doing
its job correctly&quot;.</p>
<p>We already saw examples of illegal and legal impls:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo { }
trait Bar where Self: Foo { }

struct X;
struct Y;

impl Bar for X {
    // This impl is not legal: the `Bar` trait requires that we also
    // implement `Foo`, and we didn't.
}

impl Foo for Y {
    // This impl is legal: there is nothing to check as there are no where
    // clauses on the `Foo` trait.
}

impl Bar for Y {
    // This impl is legal: we have a `Foo` impl for `Y`.
}
</code></pre>
<p>We must define what &quot;legal&quot; and &quot;illegal&quot; mean. For this, we introduce another
predicate: <code>WellFormed(Type: Trait)</code>. We say that the trait reference
<code>Type: Trait</code> is well-formed if <code>Type</code> meets the bounds written on the
<code>Trait</code> declaration. For each impl we write, assuming that the where clauses
declared on the impl hold, the compiler tries to prove that the corresponding
trait reference is well-formed. The impl is legal if the compiler manages to do
so.</p>
<p>Coming to the definition of <code>WellFormed(Type: Trait)</code>, it would be tempting
to define it as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Trait where WC1, WC2, ..., WCn {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;Type&gt; {
    WellFormed(Type: Trait) :- WC1 &amp;&amp; WC2 &amp;&amp; .. &amp;&amp; WCn.
}
</code></pre>
<p>and indeed this was basically what was done in rustc until it was noticed that
this mixed badly with implied bounds. The key thing is that implied bounds
allows someone to derive all bounds implied by a fact in the environment, and
this <em>transitively</em> as we've seen with the <code>A + B + C</code> traits example.
However, the <code>WellFormed</code> predicate as defined above only checks that the
<em>direct</em> superbounds hold. That is, if we come back to our <code>A + B + C</code>
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait A { }
// No where clauses, always well-formed.
// forall&lt;Type&gt; { WellFormed(Type: A). }

trait B where Self: A { }
// We only check the direct superbound `Self: A`.
// forall&lt;Type&gt; { WellFormed(Type: B) :- Implemented(Type: A). }

trait C where Self: B { }
// We only check the direct superbound `Self: B`. We do not check
// the `Self: A` implied bound  coming from the `Self: B` superbound.
// forall&lt;Type&gt; { WellFormed(Type: C) :- Implemented(Type: B). }
</code></pre>
<p>There is an asymmetry between the recursive power of implied bounds and
the shallow checking of <code>WellFormed</code>. It turns out that this asymmetry
can be <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/43786">exploited</a>. Indeed, suppose that we define the following
traits:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Partial where Self: Copy { }
// WellFormed(Self: Partial) :- Implemented(Self: Copy).

trait Complete where Self: Partial { }
// WellFormed(Self: Complete) :- Implemented(Self: Partial).

impl&lt;T&gt; Partial for T where T: Complete { }

impl&lt;T&gt; Complete for T { }
</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>Partial</code> impl, what the compiler must prove is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;T&gt; {
    if (T: Complete) { // assume that the where clauses hold
        WellFormed(T: Partial) // show that the trait reference is well-formed
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Proving <code>WellFormed(T: Partial)</code> amounts to proving <code>Implemented(T: Copy)</code>.
However, we have <code>Implemented(T: Complete)</code> in our environment: thanks to
implied bounds, we can deduce <code>Implemented(T: Partial)</code>. Using implied bounds
one level deeper, we can deduce <code>Implemented(T: Copy)</code>. Finally, the <code>Partial</code>
impl is legal.</p>
<p>For the <code>Complete</code> impl, what the compiler must prove is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;T&gt; {
    WellFormed(T: Complete) // show that the trait reference is well-formed
}
</code></pre>
<p>Proving <code>WellFormed(T: Complete)</code> amounts to proving <code>Implemented(T: Partial)</code>.
We see that the <code>impl Partial for T</code> applies if we can prove
<code>Implemented(T: Complete)</code>, and it turns out we can prove this fact since our
<code>impl&lt;T&gt; Complete for T</code> is a blanket impl without any where clauses.</p>
<p>So both impls are legal and the compiler accepts the program. Moreover, thanks
to the <code>Complete</code> blanket impl, all types implement <code>Complete</code>. So we could
now use this impl like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn eat&lt;T&gt;(x: T) { }

fn copy_everything&lt;T: Complete&gt;(x: T) {
    eat(x);
    eat(x);
}

fn main() {
    let not_copiable = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    copy_everything(not_copiable);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this program, we use the fact that <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> implements <code>Complete</code>, as any
other type. Hence we can call <code>copy_everything</code> with an argument of type
<code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code>. Inside the <code>copy_everything</code> function, we have the
<code>Implemented(T: Complete)</code> bound in our environment. Thanks to implied bounds,
we can deduce <code>Implemented(T: Partial)</code>. Using implied bounds again, we deduce
<code>Implemented(T: Copy)</code> and we can indeed call the <code>eat</code> function which moves
the argument twice since its argument is <code>Copy</code>. Problem: the <code>T</code> type was
in fact <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;</code> which is not copy at all, hence we will double-free the
underlying vec storage so we have a memory unsoundness in safe Rust.</p>
<p>Of course, disregarding the asymmetry between <code>WellFormed</code> and implied bounds,
this bug was possible only because we had some kind of self-referencing impls.
But self-referencing impls are very useful in practice and are not the real
culprits in this affair.</p>
<a class="header" href="#co-inductiveness-of-wellformed" id="co-inductiveness-of-wellformed"><h2>Co-inductiveness of <code>WellFormed</code></h2></a>
<p>So the solution is to fix this asymmetry between <code>WellFormed</code> and implied
bounds. For that, we need for the <code>WellFormed</code> predicate to not only require
that the direct superbounds hold, but also all the bounds transitively implied
by the superbounds. What we can do is to have the following rules for the
<code>WellFormed</code> predicate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait A { }
// WellFormed(Self: A) :- Implemented(Self: A).

trait B where Self: A { }
// WellFormed(Self: B) :- Implemented(Self: B) &amp;&amp; WellFormed(Self: A).

trait C where Self: B { }
// WellFormed(Self: C) :- Implemented(Self: C) &amp;&amp; WellFormed(Self: B).
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we are now also requiring <code>Implemented(Self: Trait)</code> for
<code>WellFormed(Self: Trait)</code> to be true: this is to simplify the process of
traversing all the implied bounds transitively. This does not change anything
when checking whether impls are legal, because since we assume
that the where clauses hold inside the impl, we know that the corresponding
trait reference do hold. Thanks to this setup, you can see that we indeed
require to prove the set of all bounds transitively implied by the where
clauses.</p>
<p>However there is still a catch. Suppose that we have the following trait
definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo where &lt;Self as Foo&gt;::Item: Foo {
    type Item;
}
</code></pre>
<p>so this definition is a bit more involved than the ones we've seen already
because it defines an associated item. However, the well-formedness rule
would not be more complicated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">WellFormed(Self: Foo) :-
    Implemented(Self: Foo) &amp;&amp;
    WellFormed(&lt;Self as Foo&gt;::Item: Foo).
</code></pre>
<p>Now we would like to write the following impl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Foo for i32 {
    type Item = i32;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Foo</code> trait definition and the <code>impl Foo for i32</code> are perfectly valid
Rust: we're kind of recursively using our <code>Foo</code> impl in order to show that
the associated value indeed implements <code>Foo</code>, but that's ok. But if we
translate this to our well-formedness setting, the compiler proof process
inside the <code>Foo</code> impl is the following: it starts with proving that the
well-formedness goal <code>WellFormed(i32: Foo)</code> is true. In order to do that,
it must prove the following goals: <code>Implemented(i32: Foo)</code> and
<code>WellFormed(&lt;i32 as Foo&gt;::Item: Foo)</code>. <code>Implemented(i32: Foo)</code> holds because
there is our impl and there are no where clauses on it so it's always true.
However, because of the associated type value we used,
<code>WellFormed(&lt;i32 as Foo&gt;::Item: Foo)</code> simplifies to just
<code>WellFormed(i32: Foo)</code>. So in order to prove its original goal
<code>WellFormed(i32: Foo)</code>, the compiler needs to prove <code>WellFormed(i32: Foo)</code>:
this clearly is a cycle and cycles are usually rejected by the trait solver,
unless...  if the <code>WellFormed</code> predicate was made to be co-inductive.</p>
<p>A co-inductive predicate, as discussed in the chapter on
<a href="traits/./goals-and-clauses.html#coinductive-goals">goals and clauses</a>, are predicates
for which the
trait solver accepts cycles. In our setting, this would be a valid thing to do:
indeed, the <code>WellFormed</code> predicate just serves as a way of enumerating all
the implied bounds. Hence, it's like a fixed point algorithm: it tries to grow
the set of implied bounds until there is nothing more to add. Here, a cycle
in the chain of <code>WellFormed</code> predicates just means that there is no more bounds
to add in that direction, so we can just accept this cycle and focus on other
directions. It's easy to prove that under these co-inductive semantics, we
are effectively visiting all the transitive implied bounds, and only these.</p>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds-on-types" id="implied-bounds-on-types"><h2>Implied bounds on types</h2></a>
<p>We mainly talked about implied bounds for traits because this was the most
subtle regarding implementation. Implied bounds on types are simpler,
especially because if we assume that a type is well-formed, we don't use that
fact to deduce that other types are well-formed, we only use it to deduce
that e.g. some trait bounds hold.</p>
<p>For types, we just use rules like these ones:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Type&lt;...&gt; where WC1, ..., WCn {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;...&gt; {
    WellFormed(Type&lt;...&gt;) :- WC1, ..., WCn.
}

forall&lt;...&gt; {
    FromEnv(WC1) :- FromEnv(Type&lt;...&gt;).
    ...
    FromEnv(WCn) :- FromEnv(Type&lt;...&gt;).
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that we have this asymmetry between well-formedness check,
which only verifies that the direct superbounds hold, and implied bounds which
gives access to all bounds transitively implied by the where clauses. In that
case this is ok because as we said, we don't use <code>FromEnv(Type&lt;...&gt;)</code> to deduce
other <code>FromEnv(OtherType&lt;...&gt;)</code> things, nor do we use <code>FromEnv(Type: Trait)</code> to
deduce <code>FromEnv(OtherType&lt;...&gt;)</code> things. So in that sense type definitions are
&quot;less recursive&quot; than traits, and we saw in a previous subsection that
it was the combination of asymmetry and recursive trait / impls that led to
unsoundness. As such, the <code>WellFormed(Type&lt;...&gt;)</code> predicate does not need
to be co-inductive.</p>
<p>This asymmetry optimization is useful because in a real Rust program, we have
to check the well-formedness of types very often (e.g. for each type which
appears in the body of a function).</p>

created in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_traits/lowering/"><code>rustc_traits::lowering</code></a> module.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-program_clauses_for-query" id="the-program_clauses_for-query"><h2>The <code>program_clauses_for</code> query</h2></a>
<p>The main entry point is the <code>program_clauses_for</code> <a href="../query.html">query</a>, which –
given a def-id – produces a set of Chalk program clauses. These
queries are tested using a
<a href="#unit-tests">dedicated unit-testing mechanism, described below</a>.  The
query is invoked on a <code>DefId</code> that identifies something like a trait,
an impl, or an associated item definition. It then produces and
returns a vector of program clauses.</p>
<p><a name="unit-tests"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#unit-tests" id="unit-tests"><h2>Unit tests</h2></a>
<p>Unit tests are located in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/ui/chalkify"><code>src/test/ui/chalkify</code></a>. A good
example test is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/ui/chalkify/lower_impl.rs">the <code>lower_impl</code> test</a>. At the time of
this writing, it looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#![feature(rustc_attrs)]

trait Foo { }

#[rustc_dump_program_clauses] //~ ERROR Implemented(T: Foo) :-
impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; Foo for T where T: Iterator&lt;Item = i32&gt; { }

fn main() {
    println!(&quot;hello&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>#[rustc_dump_program_clauses]</code> annotation can be attached to
anything with a def-id.  (It requires the <code>rustc_attrs</code> feature.) The
compiler will then invoke the <code>program_clauses_for</code> query on that
item, and emit compiler errors that dump the clauses produced. These
errors just exist for unit-testing, as we can then leverage the
standard <a href="../tests/adding.html#guide-to-the-ui-tests">ui test</a> mechanisms to check them. In this case, there is a
<code>//~ ERROR Implemented</code> annotation which is intentionally minimal (it
need only be a prefix of the error), but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/ui/chalkify/lower_impl.stderr">the stderr file</a> contains
the full details:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error: Implemented(T: Foo) :- ProjectionEq(&lt;T as std::iter::Iterator&gt;::Item == i32), TypeOutlives(T \

<a class="header" href="#lowering-rules" id="lowering-rules"><h1>Lowering rules</h1></a>
<p>This section gives the complete lowering rules for Rust traits into
<a href="./goals-and-clauses.html">program clauses</a>. It is a kind of reference. These rules
reference the <a href="./goals-and-clauses.html#domain-goals">domain goals</a> defined in an earlier section.</p>
<a class="header" href="#notation" id="notation"><h2>Notation</h2></a>
<p>The nonterminal <code>Pi</code> is used to mean some generic <em>parameter</em>, either a
named lifetime like <code>'a</code> or a type parameter like <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>The nonterminal <code>Ai</code> is used to mean some generic <em>argument</em>, which
might be a lifetime like <code>'a</code> or a type like <code>Vec&lt;A&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When defining the lowering rules, we will give goals and clauses in
the <a href="./goals-and-clauses.html">notation given in this section</a>.
We sometimes insert &quot;macros&quot; like <code>LowerWhereClause!</code> into these
definitions; these macros reference other sections within this chapter.</p>
<a class="header" href="#rule-names-and-cross-references" id="rule-names-and-cross-references"><h2>Rule names and cross-references</h2></a>
<p>Each of these lowering rules is given a name, documented with a
comment like so:</p>
<pre><code>// Rule Foo-Bar-Baz
</code></pre>
<p>The reference implementation of these rules is to be found in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/master/chalk-rules/src/clauses.rs"><code>chalk/chalk-rules/src/clauses.rs</code></a>. They are also ported in
rustc in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_traits"><code>librustc_traits</code></a> crate.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-where-clauses" id="lowering-where-clauses"><h2>Lowering where clauses</h2></a>
<p>When used in a goal position, where clauses can be mapped directly to
the <code>Holds</code> variant of <a href="./goals-and-clauses.html#domain-goals">domain goals</a>, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A0: Foo&lt;A1..An&gt;</code> maps to <code>Implemented(A0: Foo&lt;A1..An&gt;)</code></li>
<li><code>T: 'r</code> maps to <code>Outlives(T, 'r)</code></li>
<li><code>'a: 'b</code> maps to <code>Outlives('a, 'b)</code></li>
<li><code>A0: Foo&lt;A1..An, Item = T&gt;</code> is a bit special and expands to two distinct
goals, namely <code>Implemented(A0: Foo&lt;A1..An&gt;)</code> and
<code>ProjectionEq(&lt;A0 as Foo&lt;A1..An&gt;&gt;::Item = T)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In the rules below, we will use <code>WC</code> to indicate where clauses that
appear in Rust syntax; we will then use the same <code>WC</code> to indicate
where those where clauses appear as goals in the program clauses that
we are producing. In that case, the mapping above is used to convert
from the Rust syntax into goals.</p>
<a class="header" href="#transforming-the-lowered-where-clauses" id="transforming-the-lowered-where-clauses"><h3>Transforming the lowered where clauses</h3></a>
<p>In addition, in the rules below, we sometimes do some transformations
on the lowered where clauses, as defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FromEnv(WC)</code> – this indicates that:
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(TraitRef)</code> becomes <code>FromEnv(TraitRef)</code></li>
<li>other where-clauses are left intact</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>WellFormed(WC)</code> – this indicates that:
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(TraitRef)</code> becomes <code>WellFormed(TraitRef)</code></li>
<li>other where-clauses are left intact</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>TODO</em>: I suspect that we want to alter the outlives relations too,
but Chalk isn't modeling those right now.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-traits" id="lowering-traits"><h2>Lowering traits</h2></a>
<p>Given a trait definition</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt; // P0 == Self
where WC
{
    // trait items
}
</code></pre>
<p>we will produce a number of declarations. This section is focused on
the program clauses for the trait header (i.e., the stuff outside the
<code>{}</code>); the <a href="#trait-items">section on trait items</a> covers the stuff
inside the <code>{}</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#trait-header" id="trait-header"><h3>Trait header</h3></a>
<p>From the trait itself we mostly make &quot;meta&quot; rules that setup the
relationships between different kinds of domain goals.  The first such
rule from the trait header creates the mapping between the <code>FromEnv</code>
and <code>Implemented</code> predicates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule Implemented-From-Env
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn&gt; {
  Implemented(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;) :- FromEnv(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;)
}
</code></pre>
<p><a name="implied-bounds"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#implied-bounds-1" id="implied-bounds-1"><h4>Implied bounds</h4></a>
<p>The next few clauses have to do with implied bounds (see also
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2089-implied-bounds.html">RFC 2089</a> and the <a href="traits/./implied-bounds.html">implied bounds</a> chapter for a more in depth
cover). For each trait, we produce two clauses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule Implied-Bound-From-Trait
//
// For each where clause WC:
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn&gt; {
  FromEnv(WC) :- FromEnv(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This clause says that if we are assuming that the trait holds, then we can also
assume that its where-clauses hold. It's perhaps useful to see an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Eq: PartialEq { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>PartialEq</code> supertrait is equivalent to a <code>where Self: PartialEq</code> where clause, in our simplified model. The program
clause above therefore states that if we can prove <code>FromEnv(T: Eq)</code> –
e.g., if we are in some function with <code>T: Eq</code> in its where clauses –
then we also know that <code>FromEnv(T: PartialEq)</code>. Thus the set of things
that follow from the environment are not only the <strong>direct where
clauses</strong> but also things that follow from them.</p>
<p>The next rule is related; it defines what it means for a trait reference
to be <strong>well-formed</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule WellFormed-TraitRef
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn&gt; {
  WellFormed(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;) :- Implemented(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;) &amp;&amp; WellFormed(WC)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>WellFormed</code> rule states that <code>T: Trait</code> is well-formed if (a)
<code>T: Trait</code> is implemented and (b) all the where-clauses declared on
<code>Trait</code> are well-formed (and hence they are implemented). Remember
that the <code>WellFormed</code> predicate is
<a href="./goals-and-clauses.html#coinductive">coinductive</a>; in this
case, it is serving as a kind of &quot;carrier&quot; that allows us to enumerate
all the where clauses that are transitively implied by <code>T: Trait</code>.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo: A + Bar { }
trait Bar: B + Foo { }
trait A { }
trait B { }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the transitive set of implications for <code>T: Foo</code> are <code>T: A</code>, <code>T: Bar</code>, and
<code>T: B</code>.  And indeed if we were to try to prove <code>WellFormed(T: Foo)</code>, we would
have to prove each one of those:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WellFormed(T: Foo)</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(T: Foo)</code></li>
<li><code>WellFormed(T: A)</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(T: A)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>WellFormed(T: Bar)</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(T: Bar)</code></li>
<li><code>WellFormed(T: B)</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Implemented(T: Bar)</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>WellFormed(T: Foo)</code> -- cycle, true coinductively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This <code>WellFormed</code> predicate is only used when proving that impls are
well-formed – basically, for each impl of some trait ref <code>TraitRef</code>,
we must show that <code>WellFormed(TraitRef)</code>. This in turn justifies the
implied bounds rules that allow us to extend the set of <code>FromEnv</code>
items.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-type-definitions" id="lowering-type-definitions"><h2>Lowering type definitions</h2></a>
<p>We also want to have some rules which define when a type is well-formed.
For example, given this type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Set&lt;K&gt; where K: Hash { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>Set&lt;i32&gt;</code> is well-formed because <code>i32</code> implements <code>Hash</code>, but
<code>Set&lt;NotHash&gt;</code> would not be well-formed. Basically, a type is well-formed
if its parameters verify the where clauses written on the type definition.</p>
<p>Hence, for every type definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Type&lt;P1..Pn&gt; where WC { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>we produce the following rule:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule WellFormed-Type
forall&lt;P1..Pn&gt; {
  WellFormed(Type&lt;P1..Pn&gt;) :- WC
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we use <code>struct</code> for defining a type, but this should be understood
as a general type definition (it could be e.g. a generic <code>enum</code>).</p>
<p>Conversely, we define rules which say that if we assume that a type is
well-formed, we can also assume that its where clauses hold. That is,
we produce the following family of rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule Implied-Bound-From-Type
//
// For each where clause `WC`
forall&lt;P1..Pn&gt; {
  FromEnv(WC) :- FromEnv(Type&lt;P1..Pn&gt;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>As for the implied bounds RFC, functions will <em>assume</em> that their arguments
are well-formed. For example, suppose we have the following bit of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Hash: Eq { }
struct Set&lt;K: Hash&gt; { ... }

fn foo&lt;K&gt;(collection: Set&lt;K&gt;, x: K, y: K) {
    // `x` and `y` can be equalized even if we did not explicitly write
    // `where K: Eq`
    if x == y {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>foo</code> function, we assume that <code>Set&lt;K&gt;</code> is well-formed, i.e. we have
<code>FromEnv(Set&lt;K&gt;)</code> in our environment. Because of the previous rule, we get
<code>FromEnv(K: Hash)</code> without needing an explicit where clause. And because
of the <code>Hash</code> trait definition, there also exists a rule which says:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;K&gt; {
  FromEnv(K: Eq) :- FromEnv(K: Hash)
}
</code></pre>
<p>which means that we finally get <code>FromEnv(K: Eq)</code> and then can compare <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> without needing an explicit where clause.</p>
<p><a name="trait-items"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-trait-items" id="lowering-trait-items"><h2>Lowering trait items</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#associated-type-declarations" id="associated-type-declarations"><h3>Associated type declarations</h3></a>
<p>Given a trait that declares a (possibly generic) associated type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt; // P0 == Self
where WC
{
    type AssocType&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt;: Bounds where WC1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We will produce a number of program clauses. The first two define
the rules by which <code>ProjectionEq</code> can succeed; these two clauses are discussed
in detail in the <a href="./associated-types.html">section on associated types</a>,
but reproduced here for reference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule ProjectionEq-Normalize
//
// ProjectionEq can succeed by normalizing:
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm, U&gt; {
  ProjectionEq(&lt;Self as Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocType&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt; = U) :-
      Normalize(&lt;Self as Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocType&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt; -&gt; U)
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule ProjectionEq-Placeholder
//
// ProjectionEq can succeed through the placeholder associated type,
// see &quot;associated type&quot; chapter for more:
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm&gt; {
  ProjectionEq(
    &lt;Self as Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocType&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt; =
    (Trait::AssocType)&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>The next rule covers implied bounds for the projection. In particular,
the <code>Bounds</code> declared on the associated type must have been proven to hold
to show that the impl is well-formed, and hence we can rely on them
elsewhere.</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule Implied-Bound-From-AssocTy
//
// For each `Bound` in `Bounds`:
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm&gt; {
    FromEnv(&lt;Self as Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocType&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt;&gt;: Bound) :-
      FromEnv(Self: Trait&lt;P1..Pn&gt;) &amp;&amp; WC1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we define the requirements for an instantiation of our associated
type to be well-formed...</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">// Rule WellFormed-AssocTy
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm&gt; {

// For each where clause WC1:
forall&lt;Self, P1..Pn, Pn+1..Pm&gt; {

<a class="header" href="#well-formedness-checking" id="well-formedness-checking"><h1>Well-formedness checking</h1></a>
<p>WF checking has the job of checking that the various declarations in a Rust
program are well-formed. This is the basis for implied bounds, and partly for
that reason, this checking can be surprisingly subtle! For example, we
have to be sure that each impl proves the WF conditions declared on
the trait.</p>
<p>For each declaration in a Rust program, we will generate a logical goal and try
to prove it using the lowered rules we described in the
<a href="traits/./lowering-rules.html">lowering rules</a> chapter. If we are able to prove it, we
say that the construct is well-formed. If not, we report an error to the user.</p>
<p>Well-formedness checking happens in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/master/chalk-rules/src/wf.rs"><code>chalk/chalk-rules/src/wf.rs</code></a>
module in chalk. After you have read this chapter, you may find useful to see
an extended set of examples in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/master/src/test/wf.rs"><code>chalk/src/test/wf.rs</code></a> submodule.</p>
<p>The new-style WF checking has not been implemented in rustc yet.</p>
<p>We give here a complete reference of the generated goals for each Rust
declaration.</p>
<p>In addition to the notations introduced in the chapter about
lowering rules, we'll introduce another notation: when checking WF of a
declaration, we'll often have to prove that all types that appear are
well-formed, except type parameters that we always assume to be WF. Hence,
we'll use the following notation: for a type <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>, we define
<code>InputTypes(SomeType&lt;...&gt;)</code> to be the set of all non-parameter types appearing
in <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code>, including <code>SomeType&lt;...&gt;</code> itself.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>InputTypes((u32, f32)) = [u32, f32, (u32, f32)]</code></li>
<li><code>InputTypes(Box&lt;T&gt;) = [Box&lt;T&gt;]</code> (assuming that <code>T</code> is a type parameter)</li>
<li><code>InputTypes(Box&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;) = [Box&lt;T&gt;, Box&lt;Box&lt;T&gt;&gt;]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We also extend the <code>InputTypes</code> notation to where clauses in the natural way.
So, for example <code>InputTypes(A0: Trait&lt;A1,...,An&gt;)</code> is the union of
<code>InputTypes(A0)</code>, <code>InputTypes(A1)</code>, ..., <code>InputTypes(An)</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#type-definitions" id="type-definitions"><h1>Type definitions</h1></a>
<p>Given a general type definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Type&lt;P...&gt; where WC_type {
    field1: A1,
    ...
    fieldn: An,
}
</code></pre>
<p>we generate the following goal, which represents its well-formedness condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;P...&gt; {
    if (FromEnv(WC_type)) {
        WellFormed(InputTypes(WC_type)) &amp;&amp;
            WellFormed(InputTypes(A1)) &amp;&amp;
            ...
            WellFormed(InputTypes(An))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>which in English states: assuming that the where clauses defined on the type
hold, prove that every type appearing in the type definition is well-formed.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct OnlyClone&lt;T&gt; where T: Clone {
    clonable: T,
}
// The only types appearing are type parameters: we have nothing to check,
// the type definition is well-formed.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo&lt;T&gt; where T: Clone {
    foo: OnlyClone&lt;T&gt;,
}
// The only non-parameter type which appears in this definition is
// `OnlyClone&lt;T&gt;`. The generated goal is the following:
// ```
// forall&lt;T&gt; {
//     if (FromEnv(T: Clone)) {
//          WellFormed(OnlyClone&lt;T&gt;)
//     }
// }
// ```
// which is provable.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Bar&lt;T&gt; where &lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item: Debug {
    bar: i32,
}
// The only non-parameter types which appear in this definition are
// `&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item` and `i32`. The generated goal is the following:
// ```
// forall&lt;T&gt; {
//     if (FromEnv(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item: Debug)) {
//          WellFormed(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item) &amp;&amp;
//               WellFormed(i32)
//     }
// }
// ```
// which is not provable since `WellFormed(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item)` requires
// proving `Implemented(T: Iterator)`, and we are unable to prove that for an
// unknown `T`.
//
// Hence, this type definition is considered illegal. An additional

    if (FromEnv(WC_trait)) {
        WellFormed(InputTypes(WC_trait)) &amp;&amp;

            forall&lt;P2...&gt; {
                if (FromEnv(WC_assoc)) {
                    WellFormed(InputTypes(Bounds_assoc)) &amp;&amp;
                        WellFormed(InputTypes(WC_assoc))
                }
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is not much to verify in a trait definition. We just want
to prove that the types appearing in the trait definition are well-formed,
under the assumption that the different where clauses hold.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo&lt;T&gt; where T: Iterator, &lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item: Debug {
    ...
}
// The only non-parameter type which appears in this definition is
// `&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item`. The generated goal is the following:
// ```
// forall&lt;T&gt; {
//     if (FromEnv(T: Iterator), FromEnv(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item: Debug)) {
//         WellFormed(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item)
//     }
// }
// ```
// which is provable thanks to the `FromEnv(T: Iterator)` assumption.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Bar {
    type Assoc&lt;T&gt;: From&lt;&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item&gt;;
}
// The only non-parameter type which appears in this definition is
// `&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item`. The generated goal is the following:
// ```
// forall&lt;T&gt; {
//     WellFormed(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item)
// }
// ```
// which is not provable, hence the trait definition is considered illegal.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Baz {
    type Assoc&lt;T&gt;: From&lt;&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item&gt; where T: Iterator;
}
// The generated goal is now:

// forall&lt;T&gt; {
//     if (FromEnv(T: Iterator)) {
//         WellFormed(&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item)
//     }
// }
// ```
// which is now provable.
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#impls" id="impls"><h1>Impls</h1></a>
<p>Now we give ourselves a general impl for the trait defined above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;P1...&gt; Trait&lt;A1...&gt; for SomeType&lt;A2...&gt; where WC_impl {
    type Assoc&lt;P2...&gt; = SomeValue&lt;A3...&gt; where WC_assoc;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that here, <code>WC_assoc</code> are the same where clauses as those defined on the
associated type definition in the trait declaration, <em>except</em> that type
parameters from the trait are substituted with values provided by the impl
(see example below). You cannot add new where clauses. You may omit to write
the where clauses if you want to emphasize the fact that you are actually not
relying on them.</p>
<p>Some examples to illustrate that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo&lt;T&gt; {
    type Assoc where T: Clone;
}

struct OnlyClone&lt;T: Clone&gt; { ... }

impl&lt;U&gt; Foo&lt;Option&lt;U&gt;&gt; for () {
    // We substitute type parameters from the trait by the ones provided
    // by the impl, that is instead of having a `T: Clone` where clause,
    // we have an `Option&lt;U&gt;: Clone` one.
    type Assoc = OnlyClone&lt;Option&lt;U&gt;&gt; where Option&lt;U&gt;: Clone;
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; for i32 {
    // I'm not using the `T: Clone` where clause from the trait, so I can
    // omit it.
    type Assoc = u32;
}

impl&lt;T&gt; Foo&lt;T&gt; for f32 {
    type Assoc = OnlyClone&lt;Option&lt;T&gt;&gt; where Option&lt;T&gt;: Clone;
    //                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //                                this where clause does not exist
    //                                on the original trait decl: illegal
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>So in Rust, where clauses on associated types work <em>exactly</em> like where
clauses on trait methods: in an impl, we must substitute the parameters from
the traits with values provided by the impl, we may omit them if we don't
need them, but we cannot add new where clauses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now let's see the generated goal for this general impl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;P1...&gt; {
    // Well-formedness of types appearing in the impl
    if (FromEnv(WC_impl), FromEnv(InputTypes(SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;))) {
        WellFormed(InputTypes(WC_impl)) &amp;&amp;

            forall&lt;P2...&gt; {
                if (FromEnv(WC_assoc)) {
                        WellFormed(InputTypes(SomeValue&lt;A3...&gt;))
                }
            }
    }

    // Implied bounds checking
    if (FromEnv(WC_impl), FromEnv(InputTypes(SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;))) {
        WellFormed(SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;) &amp;&amp;

            forall&lt;P2...&gt; {
                if (FromEnv(WC_assoc)) {
                    WellFormed(SomeValue&lt;A3...&gt;: Bounds_assoc)
                }
            }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the most complex goal. As always, first, assuming that
the various where clauses hold, we prove that every type appearing in the impl
is well-formed, <strong><em>except</em></strong> types appearing in the impl header
<code>SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;</code>. Instead, we <em>assume</em> that those types are
well-formed
(hence the <code>if (FromEnv(InputTypes(SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;)))</code>
conditions). This is
part of the implied bounds proposal, so that we can rely on the bounds
written on the definition of e.g. the <code>SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;</code> type (and that we don't
need to repeat those bounds).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that we don't need to check well-formedness of types appearing in
<code>WC_assoc</code> because we already did that in the trait decl (they are just
repeated with some substitutions of values which we already assume to be
well-formed)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, still assuming that the where clauses on the impl <code>WC_impl</code> hold and that
the input types of <code>SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;</code> are well-formed, we prove that
<code>WellFormed(SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;: Trait&lt;A1...&gt;)</code> hold. That is, we want to prove
that <code>SomeType&lt;A2...&gt;</code> verify all the where clauses that might transitively
be required by the <code>Trait</code> definition (see
<a href="traits/./implied-bounds.html#co-inductiveness-of-wellformed">this subsection</a>).</p>
<p>Lastly, assuming in addition that the where clauses on the associated type
<code>WC_assoc</code> hold,
we prove that <code>WellFormed(SomeValue&lt;A3...&gt;: Bounds_assoc)</code> hold. Again, we are
not only proving <code>Implemented(SomeValue&lt;A3...&gt;: Bounds_assoc)</code>, but also
all the facts that might transitively come from <code>Bounds_assoc</code>. We must do this
because we allow the use of implied bounds on associated types: if we have
<code>FromEnv(SomeType: Trait)</code> in our environment, the lowering rules
chapter indicates that we are able to deduce
<code>FromEnv(&lt;SomeType as Trait&gt;::Assoc: Bounds_assoc)</code> without knowing what the
precise value of <code>&lt;SomeType as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code> is.</p>
<p>Some examples for the generated goal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Trait Program Clauses

<a class="header" href="#canonical-queries" id="canonical-queries"><h1>Canonical queries</h1></a>
<p>The &quot;start&quot; of the trait system is the <strong>canonical query</strong> (these are
both queries in the more general sense of the word – something you
would like to know the answer to – and in the
<a href="../query.html">rustc-specific sense</a>).  The idea is that the type
checker or other parts of the system, may in the course of doing their
thing want to know whether some trait is implemented for some type
(e.g., is <code>u32: Debug</code> true?). Or they may want to
<a href="./associated-types.html">normalize some associated type</a>.</p>
<p>This section covers queries at a fairly high level of abstraction. The
subsections look a bit more closely at how these ideas are implemented
in rustc.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-traditional-interactive-prolog-query" id="the-traditional-interactive-prolog-query"><h2>The traditional, interactive Prolog query</h2></a>
<p>In a traditional Prolog system, when you start a query, the solver
will run off and start supplying you with every possible answer it can
find. So given something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;?U&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The solver might answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;[i32]&gt;
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>continue</code> bit is interesting. The idea in Prolog is that the
solver is finding <strong>all possible</strong> instantiations of your query that
are true. In this case, if we instantiate <code>?U = [i32]</code>, then the query
is true (note that a traditional Prolog interface does not, directly,
tell us a value for <code>?U</code>, but we can infer one by unifying the
response with our original query – Rust's solver gives back a
substitution instead). If we were to hit <code>y</code>, the solver might then
give us another possible answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;&gt;
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>This answer derives from the fact that there is a reflexive impl
(<code>impl&lt;T&gt; AsRef&lt;T&gt; for T</code>) for <code>AsRef</code>. If were to hit <code>y</code> again,
then we might get back a negative response:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">no
</code></pre>
<p>Naturally, in some cases, there may be no possible answers, and hence
the solver will just give me back <code>no</code> right away:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Box&lt;i32&gt;: Copy
    no
</code></pre>
<p>In some cases, there might be an infinite number of responses. So for
example if I gave this query, and I kept hitting <code>y</code>, then the solver
would never stop giving me back answers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Clone
    Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can imagine, the solver will gleefully keep adding another
layer of <code>Box</code> until we ask it to stop, or it runs out of memory.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that queries might still have variables
in them. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone
</code></pre>
<p>might produce the answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>After all, <code>Rc&lt;?T&gt;</code> is true <strong>no matter what type <code>?T</code> is</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="query-response"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#a-trait-query-in-rustc" id="a-trait-query-in-rustc"><h2>A trait query in rustc</h2></a>
<p>The trait queries in rustc work somewhat differently. Instead of
trying to enumerate <strong>all possible</strong> answers for you, they are looking
for an <strong>unambiguous</strong> answer. In particular, when they tell you the
value for a type variable, that means that this is the <strong>only possible
instantiation</strong> that you could use, given the current set of impls and
where-clauses, that would be provable. (Internally within the solver,
though, they can potentially enumerate all possible answers. See
<a href="./slg.html">the description of the SLG solver</a> for details.)</p>
<p>The response to a trait query in rustc is typically a
<code>Result&lt;QueryResult&lt;T&gt;, NoSolution&gt;</code> (where the <code>T</code> will vary a bit
depending on the query itself). The <code>Err(NoSolution)</code> case indicates
that the query was false and had no answers (e.g., <code>Box&lt;i32&gt;: Copy</code>).
Otherwise, the <code>QueryResult</code> gives back information about the possible answer(s)
we did find. It consists of four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certainty:</strong> tells you how sure we are of this answer. It can have two
values:
<ul>
<li><code>Proven</code> means that the result is known to be true.
<ul>
<li>This might be the result for trying to prove <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone</code>,
say, or <code>Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Ambiguous</code> means that there were things we could not yet prove to
be either true <em>or</em> false, typically because more type information
was needed. (We'll see an example shortly.)
<ul>
<li>This might be the result for trying to prove <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Clone</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Var values:</strong> Values for each of the unbound inference variables
(like <code>?T</code>) that appeared in your original query. (Remember that in Prolog,
we had to infer these.)
<ul>
<li>As we'll see in the example below, we can get back var values even
for <code>Ambiguous</code> cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Region constraints:</strong> these are relations that must hold between
the lifetimes that you supplied as inputs. We'll ignore these here,
but see the
<a href="./regions.html">section on handling regions in traits</a> for
more details.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> The query result also comes with a value of type <code>T</code>. For
some specialized queries – like normalizing associated types –
this is used to carry back an extra result, but it's often just
<code>()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#examples" id="examples"><h3>Examples</h3></a>
<p>Let's work through an example query to see what all the parts mean.
Consider <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html">the <code>Borrow</code> trait</a>. This trait has a number of
impls; among them, there are these two (for clarity, I've written the
<code>Sized</code> bounds explicitly):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;T&gt; for T where T: ?Sized
impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;[T]&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; where T: Sized
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Imagine we are type-checking this (rather artificial)
bit of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;A, B&gt;(a: A, vec_b: Option&lt;B&gt;) where A: Borrow&lt;B&gt; { }

fn main() {
    let mut t: Vec&lt;_&gt; = vec![]; // Type: Vec&lt;?T&gt;
    let mut u: Option&lt;_&gt; = None; // Type: Option&lt;?U&gt;
    foo(t, u); // Example 1: requires `Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;`
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>As the comments indicate, we first create two variables <code>t</code> and <code>u</code>;
<code>t</code> is an empty vector and <code>u</code> is a <code>None</code> option. Both of these
variables have unbound inference variables in their type: <code>?T</code>
represents the elements in the vector <code>t</code> and <code>?U</code> represents the
value stored in the option <code>u</code>.  Next, we invoke <code>foo</code>; comparing the
signature of <code>foo</code> to its arguments, we wind up with <code>A = Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code> and
<code>B = ?U</code>.Therefore, the where clause on <code>foo</code> requires that <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>. This is thus our first example trait query.</p>
<p>There are many possible solutions to the query <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>;
for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>?U = Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code>,</li>
<li><code>?U = [?T]</code>,</li>
<li><code>?T = u32, ?U = [u32]</code></li>
<li>and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the result we get back would be as follows (I'm going to
ignore region constraints and the &quot;value&quot;):</p>
<ul>
<li>Certainty: <code>Ambiguous</code> – we're not sure yet if this holds</li>
<li>Var values: <code>[?T = ?T, ?U = ?U]</code> – we learned nothing about the values of
the variables</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the query result says that it is too soon to say much about
whether this trait is proven. During type-checking, this is not an
immediate error: instead, the type checker would hold on to this
requirement (<code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>) and wait. As we'll see in the next
example, it may happen that <code>?T</code> and <code>?U</code> wind up constrained from
other sources, in which case we can try the trait query again.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> We can now extend our previous example a bit,
and assign a value to <code>u</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;A, B&gt;(a: A, vec_b: Option&lt;B&gt;) where A: Borrow&lt;B&gt; { }

fn main() {
    // What we saw before:
    let mut t: Vec&lt;_&gt; = vec![]; // Type: Vec&lt;?T&gt;
    let mut u: Option&lt;_&gt; = None; // Type: Option&lt;?U&gt;
    foo(t, u); // `Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;` =&gt; ambiguous

    // New stuff:
    u = Some(vec![]); // ?U = Vec&lt;?V&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As a result of this assignment, the type of <code>u</code> is forced to be
<code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;?V&gt;&gt;</code>, where <code>?V</code> represents the element type of the
vector. This in turn implies that <code>?U</code> is <a href="../type-checking.html">unified</a> to <code>Vec&lt;?V&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that the type checker decides to revisit the
&quot;as-yet-unproven&quot; trait obligation we saw before, <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>. <code>?U</code> is no longer an unbound inference variable; it now
has a value, <code>Vec&lt;?V&gt;</code>. So, if we &quot;refresh&quot; the query with that value, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;Vec&lt;?V&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This time, there is only one impl that applies, the reflexive impl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;T&gt; for T where T: ?Sized
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the trait checker will answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certainty: <code>Proven</code></li>
<li>Var values: <code>[?T = ?T, ?V = ?T]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, it is saying that we have indeed proven that the obligation
holds, and we also know that <code>?T</code> and <code>?V</code> are the same type (but we
don't know what that type is yet!).</p>
<p>(In fact, as the function ends here, the type checker would give an
error at this point, since the element types of <code>t</code> and <code>u</code> are still
not yet known, even though they are known to be the same.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#canonicalization" id="canonicalization"><h1>Canonicalization</h1></a>
<p>Canonicalization is the process of <strong>isolating</strong> an inference value
from its context. It is a key part of implementing
<a href="./canonical-queries.html">canonical queries</a>, and you may wish to read the parent chapter
to get more context.</p>
<p>Canonicalization is really based on a very simple concept: every
<a href="../type-inference.html#vars">inference variable</a> is always in one of
two states: either it is <strong>unbound</strong>, in which case we don't know yet
what type it is, or it is <strong>bound</strong>, in which case we do. So to
isolate some data-structure T that contains types/regions from its
environment, we just walk down and find the unbound variables that
appear in T; those variables get replaced with &quot;canonical variables&quot;,
starting from zero and numbered in a fixed order (left to right, for
the most part, but really it doesn't matter as long as it is
consistent).</p>
<p>So, for example, if we have the type <code>X = (?T, ?U)</code>, where <code>?T</code> and
<code>?U</code> are distinct, unbound inference variables, then the canonical
form of <code>X</code> would be <code>(?0, ?1)</code>, where <code>?0</code> and <code>?1</code> represent these
<strong>canonical placeholders</strong>. Note that the type <code>Y = (?U, ?T)</code> also
canonicalizes to <code>(?0, ?1)</code>. But the type <code>Z = (?T, ?T)</code> would
canonicalize to <code>(?0, ?0)</code> (as would <code>(?U, ?U)</code>). In other words, the
exact identity of the inference variables is not important – unless
they are repeated.</p>
<p>We use this to improve caching as well as to detect cycles and other
things during trait resolution. Roughly speaking, the idea is that if
two trait queries have the same canonical form, then they will get
the same answer. That answer will be expressed in terms of the
canonical variables (<code>?0</code>, <code>?1</code>), which we can then map back to the
original variables (<code>?T</code>, <code>?U</code>).</p>
<a class="header" href="#canonicalizing-the-query" id="canonicalizing-the-query"><h2>Canonicalizing the query</h2></a>
<p>To see how it works, imagine that we are asking to solve the following
trait query: <code>?A: Foo&lt;'static, ?B&gt;</code>, where <code>?A</code> and <code>?B</code> are unbound.
This query contains two unbound variables, but it also contains the
lifetime <code>'static</code>. The trait system generally ignores all lifetimes
and treats them equally, so when canonicalizing, we will <em>also</em>
replace any <a href="../appendix/background.html#free-vs-bound">free lifetime</a> with a
canonical variable (Note that <code>'static</code> is actually a <em>free</em> lifetime
variable here. We are not considering it in the typing context of the whole
program but only in the context of this trait reference. Mathematically, we
are not quantifying over the whole program, but only this obligation).
Therefore, we get the following result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?0: Foo&lt;'?1, ?2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes we write this differently, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;T,L,T&gt; { ?0: Foo&lt;'?1, ?2&gt; }
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>for&lt;&gt;</code> gives some information about each of the canonical
variables within.  In this case, each <code>T</code> indicates a type variable,
so <code>?0</code> and <code>?2</code> are types; the <code>L</code> indicates a lifetime variable, so
<code>?1</code> is a lifetime. The <code>canonicalize</code> method <em>also</em> gives back a
<code>CanonicalVarValues</code> array OV with the &quot;original values&quot; for each
canonicalized variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[?A, 'static, ?B]
</code></pre>
<p>We'll need this vector OV later, when we process the query response.</p>
<a class="header" href="#executing-the-query" id="executing-the-query"><h2>Executing the query</h2></a>
<p>Once we've constructed the canonical query, we can try to solve it.
To do so, we will wind up creating a fresh inference context and
<strong>instantiating</strong> the canonical query in that context. The idea is that
we create a substitution S from the canonical form containing a fresh
inference variable (of suitable kind) for each canonical variable.
So, for our example query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;T,L,T&gt; { ?0: Foo&lt;'?1, ?2&gt; }
</code></pre>
<p>the substitution S might be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">S = [?A, '?B, ?C]
</code></pre>
<p>We can then replace the bound canonical variables (<code>?0</code>, etc) with
these inference variables, yielding the following fully instantiated
query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?A: Foo&lt;'?B, ?C&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that substitution S though! We're going to need it later.</p>
<p>OK, now that we have a fresh inference context and an instantiated
query, we can go ahead and try to solve it. The trait solver itself is
explained in more detail in <a href="./slg.html">another section</a>, but
suffice to say that it will compute a <a href="./canonical-queries.html#query-response">certainty value</a> (<code>Proven</code> or
<code>Ambiguous</code>) and have side-effects on the inference variables we've
created. For example, if there were only one impl of <code>Foo</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'a, X&gt; Foo&lt;'a, X&gt; for Vec&lt;X&gt;
where X: 'a
{ ... }
</code></pre>
<p>then we might wind up with a certainty value of <code>Proven</code>, as well as
creating fresh inference variables <code>'?D</code> and <code>?E</code> (to represent the
parameters on the impl) and unifying as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'?B = '?D</code></li>
<li><code>?A = Vec&lt;?E&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>?C = ?E</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We would also accumulate the region constraint <code>?E: '?D</code>, due to the
where clause.</p>
<p>In order to create our final query result, we have to &quot;lift&quot; these
values out of the query's inference context and into something that
can be reapplied in our original inference context. We do that by
<strong>re-applying canonicalization</strong>, but to the <strong>query result</strong>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#canonicalizing-the-query-result" id="canonicalizing-the-query-result"><h2>Canonicalizing the query result</h2></a>
<p>As discussed in <a href="./canonical-queries.html#query-response">the parent section</a>, most trait queries wind up
with a result that brings together a &quot;certainty value&quot; <code>certainty</code>, a
result substitution <code>var_values</code>, and some region constraints. To
create this, we wind up re-using the substitution S that we created
when first instantiating our query. To refresh your memory, we had a query</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;T,L,T&gt; { ?0: Foo&lt;'?1, ?2&gt; }
</code></pre>
<p>for which we made a substutition S:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">S = [?A, '?B, ?C]
</code></pre>
<p>We then did some work which unified some of those variables with other things.
If we &quot;refresh&quot; S with the latest results, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">S = [Vec&lt;?E&gt;, '?D, ?E]
</code></pre>
<p>These are precisely the new values for the three input variables from
our original query. Note though that they include some new variables
(like <code>?E</code>). We can make those go away by canonicalizing again! We don't
just canonicalize S, though, we canonicalize the whole query response QR:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">QR = {
    certainty: Proven,             // or whatever
    var_values: [Vec&lt;?E&gt;, '?D, ?E] // this is S
    region_constraints: [?E: '?D], // from the impl
    value: (),                     // for our purposes, just (), but
                                   // in some cases this might have
                                   // a type or other info
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Canonical(QR) = for&lt;T, L&gt; {
    certainty: Proven,
    var_values: [Vec&lt;?0&gt;, '?1, ?2]
    region_constraints: [?2: '?1],
    value: (),
}
</code></pre>
<p>(One subtle point: when we canonicalize the query <strong>result</strong>, we do not
use any special treatment for free lifetimes. Note that both
references to <code>'?D</code>, for example, were converted into the same
canonical variable (<code>?1</code>). This is in contrast to the original query,
where we canonicalized every free lifetime into a fresh canonical
variable.)</p>
<p>Now, this result must be reapplied in each context where needed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#processing-the-canonicalized-query-result" id="processing-the-canonicalized-query-result"><h2>Processing the canonicalized query result</h2></a>
<p>In the previous section we produced a canonical query result. We now have
to apply that result in our original context. If you recall, way back in the
beginning, we were trying to prove this query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?A: Foo&lt;'static, ?B&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We canonicalized that into this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;T,L,T&gt; { ?0: Foo&lt;'?1, ?2&gt; }
</code></pre>
<p>and now we got back a canonical response:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;T, L&gt; {
    certainty: Proven,
    var_values: [Vec&lt;?0&gt;, '?1, ?2]
    region_constraints: [?2: '?1],
    value: (),
}
</code></pre>
<p>We now want to apply that response to our context. Conceptually, how
we do that is to (a) instantiate each of the canonical variables in
the result with a fresh inference variable, (b) unify the values in
the result with the original values, and then (c) record the region
constraints for later. Doing step (a) would yield a result of</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{
      certainty: Proven,
      var_values: [Vec&lt;?C&gt;, '?D, ?C]
                       ^^   ^^^ fresh inference variables
      region_constraints: [?C: '?D],
      value: (),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Step (b) would then unify:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?A with Vec&lt;?C&gt;
'static with '?D
?B with ?C
</code></pre>
<p>And finally the region constraint of <code>?C: 'static</code> would be recorded
for later verification.</p>
<p>(What we <em>actually</em> do is a mildly optimized variant of that: Rather
than eagerly instantiating all of the canonical values in the result
with variables, we instead walk the vector of values, looking for
cases where the value is just a canonical variable. In our example,
<code>values[2]</code> is <code>?C</code>, so that means we can deduce that <code>?C := ?B and</code>'?D := 'static`. This gives us a partial set of values. Anything for
which we do not find a value, we create an inference variable.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-on-demand-slg-solver" id="the-on-demand-slg-solver"><h1>The On-Demand SLG solver</h1></a>
<p>Given a set of program clauses (provided by our <a href="./lowering-rules.html">lowering rules</a>)
and a query, we need to return the result of the query and the value of any
type variables we can determine. This is the job of the solver.</p>
<p>For example, <code>exists&lt;T&gt; { Vec&lt;T&gt;: FromIterator&lt;u32&gt; }</code> has one solution, so
its result is <code>Unique; substitution [?T := u32]</code>. A solution also comes with
a set of region constraints, which we'll ignore in this introduction.</p>
<a class="header" href="#goals-of-the-solver" id="goals-of-the-solver"><h2>Goals of the Solver</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#on-demand" id="on-demand"><h3>On demand</h3></a>
<p>There are often many, or even infinitely many, solutions to a query. For
example, say we want to prove that <code>exists&lt;T&gt; { Vec&lt;T&gt;: Debug }</code> for <em>some</em>
type <code>?T</code>. Our solver should be capable of yielding one answer at a time, say
<code>?T = u32</code>, then <code>?T = i32</code>, and so on, rather than iterating over every type
in the type system. If we need more answers, we can request more until we are
done. This is similar to how Prolog works.</p>
<p><em>See also: <a href="./canonical-queries.html#the-traditional-interactive-prolog-query">The traditional, interactive Prolog query</a></em></p>
<a class="header" href="#breadth-first" id="breadth-first"><h3>Breadth-first</h3></a>
<p><code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Debug</code> is true if <code>?T: Debug</code>. This leads to a cycle: <code>[Vec&lt;u32&gt;, Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;, Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;&gt;]</code>, and so on all implement <code>Debug</code>. Our
solver ought to be breadth first and consider answers like <code>[Vec&lt;u32&gt;: Debug, Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Debug, ...]</code> before it recurses, or we may never find the answer
we're looking for.</p>
<a class="header" href="#cachable" id="cachable"><h3>Cachable</h3></a>
<p>To speed up compilation, we need to cache results, including partial results
left over from past solver queries.</p>
<a class="header" href="#description-of-how-it-works" id="description-of-how-it-works"><h2>Description of how it works</h2></a>
<p>The basis of the solver is the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/forest/struct.Forest.html"><code>Forest</code></a> type. A <em>forest</em> stores a
collection of <em>tables</em> as well as a <em>stack</em>. Each <em>table</em> represents
the stored results of a particular query that is being performed, as
well as the various <em>strands</em>, which are basically suspended
computations that may be used to find more answers. Tables are
interdependent: solving one query may require solving others.</p>
<a class="header" href="#walkthrough" id="walkthrough"><h3>Walkthrough</h3></a>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to explain how the solver works is to walk
through an example. Let's imagine that we have the following program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Debug { }

struct u32 { }
impl Debug for u32 { }

struct Rc&lt;T&gt; { }
impl&lt;T: Debug&gt; Debug for Rc&lt;T&gt; { }

struct Vec&lt;T&gt; { }
impl&lt;T: Debug&gt; Debug for Vec&lt;T&gt; { }
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine that we want to find answers for the query <code>exists&lt;T&gt; { Rc&lt;T&gt;: Debug }</code>. The first step would be to u-canonicalize this query; this is the
act of giving canonical names to all the unbound inference variables based on
the order of their left-most appearance, as well as canonicalizing the
universes of any universally bound names (e.g., the <code>T</code> in <code>forall&lt;T&gt; { ... }</code>). In this case, there are no universally bound names, but the canonical
form Q of the query might look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>?0</code> is a variable in the root universe U0. We would then go and
look for a table with this canonical query as the key: since the forest is
empty, this lookup will fail, and we will create a new table T0,
corresponding to the u-canonical goal Q.</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring negative reasoning and regions.</strong> To start, we'll ignore
the possibility of negative goals like <code>not { Foo }</code>. We'll phase them
in later, as they bring several complications.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a table.</strong> When we first create a table, we also initialize
it with a set of <em>initial strands</em>. A &quot;strand&quot; is kind of like a
&quot;thread&quot; for the solver: it contains a particular way to produce an
answer. The initial set of strands for a goal like <code>Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug</code>
(i.e., a &quot;domain goal&quot;) is determined by looking for <em>clauses</em> in the
environment. In Rust, these clauses derive from impls, but also from
where-clauses that are in scope. In the case of our example, there
would be three clauses, each coming from the program. Using a
Prolog-like notation, these look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(u32: Debug).
(Rc&lt;T&gt;: Debug) :- (T: Debug).
(Vec&lt;T&gt;: Debug) :- (T: Debug).
</code></pre>
<p>To create our initial strands, then, we will try to apply each of
these clauses to our goal of <code>Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug</code>. The first and third
clauses are inapplicable because <code>u32</code> and <code>Vec&lt;?0&gt;</code> cannot be unified
with <code>Rc&lt;?0&gt;</code>. The second clause, however, will work.</p>
<p><strong>What is a strand?</strong> Let's talk a bit more about what a strand <em>is</em>. In the code, a strand
is the combination of an inference table, an <em>X-clause</em>, and (possibly)
a selected subgoal from that X-clause. But what is an X-clause
(<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/struct.ExClause.html"><code>ExClause</code></a>, in the code)? An X-clause pulls together a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current state of the goal we are trying to prove;</li>
<li>A set of subgoals that have yet to be proven;</li>
<li>There are also a few things we're ignoring for now:
<ul>
<li>delayed literals, region constraints</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general form of an X-clause is written much like a Prolog clause,
but with somewhat different semantics. Since we're ignoring delayed
literals and region constraints, an X-clause just looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">G :- L
</code></pre>
<p>where G is a goal and L is a set of subgoals that must be proven.
(The L stands for <em>literal</em> -- when we address negative reasoning, a
literal will be either a positive or negative subgoal.) The idea is
that if we are able to prove L then the goal G can be considered true.</p>
<p>In the case of our example, we would wind up creating one strand, with
an X-clause like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- (?T: Debug)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the <code>?T</code> refers to one of the inference variables created in the
inference table that accompanies the strand. (I'll use named variables
to refer to inference variables, and numbered variables like <code>?0</code> to
refer to variables in a canonicalized goal; in the code, however, they
are both represented with an index.)</p>
<p>For each strand, we also optionally store a <em>selected subgoal</em>. This
is the subgoal after the turnstile (<code>:-</code>) that we are currently trying
to prove in this strand. Initally, when a strand is first created,
there is no selected subgoal.</p>
<p><strong>Activating a strand.</strong> Now that we have created the table T0 and
initialized it with strands, we have to actually try and produce an answer.
We do this by invoking the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/forest/struct.Forest.html#method.ensure_root_answer"><code>ensure_root_answer</code></a> operation on the table:
specifically, we say <code>ensure_root_answer(T0, A0)</code>, meaning &quot;ensure that there
is a 0th answer A0 to query T0&quot;.</p>
<p>Remember that tables store not only strands, but also a vector of cached
answers. The first thing that <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/forest/struct.Forest.html#method.ensure_root_answer"><code>ensure_root_answer</code></a> does is to check whether
answer A0 is in this vector. If so, we can just return immediately. In this
case, the vector will be empty, and hence that does not apply (this becomes
important for cyclic checks later on).</p>
<p>When there is no cached answer, <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/forest/struct.Forest.html#method.ensure_root_answer"><code>ensure_root_answer</code></a> will try to produce one.
It does this by selecting a strand from the set of active strands -- the
strands are stored in a <code>VecDeque</code> and hence processed in a round-robin
fashion. Right now, we have only one strand, storing the following X-clause
with no selected subgoal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- (?T: Debug)
</code></pre>
<p>When we activate the strand, we see that we have no selected subgoal,
and so we first pick one of the subgoals to process. Here, there is only
one (<code>?T: Debug</code>), so that becomes the selected subgoal, changing
the state of the strand to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">(Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- selected(?T: Debug, A0)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we write <code>selected(L, An)</code> to indicate that (a) the literal <code>L</code>
is the selected subgoal and (b) which answer <code>An</code> we are looking for. We
start out looking for <code>A0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Processing the selected subgoal.</strong> Next, we have to try and find an
answer to this selected goal. To do that, we will u-canonicalize it
and try to find an associated table. In this case, the u-canonical
form of the subgoal is <code>?0: Debug</code>: we don't have a table yet for
that, so we can create a new one, T1. As before, we'll initialize T1
with strands. In this case, there will be three strands, because all
the program clauses are potentially applicable. Those three strands
will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(u32: Debug) :-</code>, derived from the program clause <code>(u32: Debug).</code>.
<ul>
<li>Note: This strand has no subgoals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>(Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Debug) :- (?U: Debug)</code>, derived from the <code>Vec</code> impl.</li>
<li><code>(Rc&lt;?U&gt;: Debug) :- (?U: Debug)</code>, derived from the <code>Rc</code> impl.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can thus summarize the state of the whole forest at this point as
follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Table T0 [Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug]
  Strands:
    (Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- selected(?T: Debug, A0)
  
Table T1 [?0: Debug]
  Strands:
    (u32: Debug) :-
    (Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Debug) :- (?U: Debug)
    (Rc&lt;?V&gt;: Debug) :- (?V: Debug)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Delegation between tables.</strong> Now that the active strand from T0 has
created the table T1, it can try to extract an answer. It does this
via that same <code>ensure_answer</code> operation we saw before. In this case,
the strand would invoke <code>ensure_answer(T1, A0)</code>, since we will start
with the first answer. This will cause T1 to activate its first
strand, <code>u32: Debug :-</code>.</p>
<p>This strand is somewhat special: it has no subgoals at all. This means
that the goal is proven. We can therefore add <code>u32: Debug</code> to the set
of <em>answers</em> for our table, calling it answer A0 (it is the first
answer). The strand is then removed from the list of strands.</p>
<p>The state of table T1 is therefore:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Table T1 [?0: Debug]
  Answers:
    A0 = [?0 = u32]
  Strand:
    (Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Debug) :- (?U: Debug)
    (Rc&lt;?V&gt;: Debug) :- (?V: Debug)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I am writing out the answer A0 as a substitution that can be
applied to the table goal; actually, in the code, the goals for each
X-clause are also represented as substitutions, but in this exposition
I've chosen to write them as full goals, following <a href="./bibliography.html#slg">NFTD</a>.</p>
<p>Since we now have an answer, <code>ensure_answer(T1, A0)</code> will return <code>Ok</code>
to the table T0, indicating that answer A0 is available. T0 now has
the job of incorporating that result into its active strand. It does
this in two ways. First, it creates a new strand that is looking for
the next possible answer of T1. Next, it incorpoates the answer from
A0 and removes the subgoal. The resulting state of table T0 is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Table T0 [Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug]
  Strands:
    (Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- selected(?T: Debug, A1)
    (Rc&lt;u32&gt;: Debug) :-
</code></pre>
<p>We then immediately activate the strand that incorporated the answer
(the <code>Rc&lt;u32&gt;: Debug</code> one). In this case, that strand has no further
subgoals, so it becomes an answer to the table T0. This answer can
then be returned up to our caller, and the whole forest goes quiescent
at this point (remember, we only do enough work to generate <em>one</em>
answer). The ending state of the forest at this point will be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Table T0 [Rc&lt;?0&gt;: Debug]
  Answer:
    A0 = [?0 = u32]
  Strands:
    (Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Debug) :- selected(?T: Debug, A1)

Table T1 [?0: Debug]
  Answers:
    A0 = [?0 = u32]
  Strand:
    (Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Debug) :- (?U: Debug)
    (Rc&lt;?V&gt;: Debug) :- (?V: Debug)
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see how the forest captures both the answers we have
created thus far <em>and</em> the strands that will let us try to produce
more answers later on.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> recasts Rust's trait system explicitly in terms of logic
programming by &quot;lowering&quot; Rust code into a kind of logic program we can then
execute queries against. (See <a href="./lowering-to-logic.html"><em>Lowering to Logic</em></a> and
<a href="./lowering-rules.html"><em>Lowering Rules</em></a>) Its goal is to be an executable, highly
readable specification of the Rust trait system.</p>
<p>There are many expected benefits from this work. It will consolidate our
existing, somewhat ad-hoc implementation into something far more principled and
expressive, which should behave better in corner cases, and be much easier to
extend.</p>
<a class="header" href="#chalk-structure" id="chalk-structure"><h2>Chalk Structure</h2></a>
<p>Chalk has two main &quot;products&quot;. The first of these is the
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_engine/index.html"><code>chalk_engine</code></a> crate, which defines the core <a href="./slg.html">SLG
solver</a>. This is the part rustc uses.</p>
<p>The rest of chalk can be considered an elaborate testing harness. Chalk is
capable of parsing Rust-like &quot;programs&quot;, lowering them to logic, and
performing queries on them.</p>
<p>Here's a sample session in the chalk repl, chalki. After feeding it our
program, we perform some queries on it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">?- program
Enter a program; press Ctrl-D when finished
| struct Foo { }
| struct Bar { }
| struct Vec&lt;T&gt; { }
| trait Clone { }
| impl&lt;T&gt; Clone for Vec&lt;T&gt; where T: Clone { }
| impl Clone for Foo { }

?- Vec&lt;Foo&gt;: Clone
Unique; substitution [], lifetime constraints []

?- Vec&lt;Bar&gt;: Clone
No possible solution.

?- exists&lt;T&gt; { Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone }
Ambiguous; no inference guidance
</code></pre>
<p>You can see more examples of programs and queries in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/4bce000801de31bf45c02f742a5fce335c9f035f/src/test.rs#L115">unit
tests</a>.</p>
<p>Next we'll go through each stage required to produce the output above.</p>
<a class="header" href="#parsing-a-hrefhttpsrust-langgithubiochalkdocchalk_parseindexhtmlchalk_parsea" id="parsing-a-hrefhttpsrust-langgithubiochalkdocchalk_parseindexhtmlchalk_parsea"><h3>Parsing (<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_parse/index.html">chalk_parse</a>)</h3></a>
<p>Chalk is designed to be incorporated with the Rust compiler, so the syntax and
concepts it deals with heavily borrow from Rust. It is convenient for the sake
of testing to be able to run chalk on its own, so chalk includes a parser for a
Rust-like syntax. This syntax is orthogonal to the Rust AST and grammar. It is
not intended to look exactly like it or support the exact same syntax.</p>
<p>The parser takes that syntax and produces an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</a>.
You can find the <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_parse/ast/index.html">complete definition of the AST</a> in the source code.</p>
<p>The syntax contains things from Rust that we know and love, for example: traits,
impls, and struct definitions. Parsing is often the first &quot;phase&quot; of
transformation that a program goes through in order to become a format that
chalk can understand.</p>

<p>After getting the AST we convert it to a more convenient intermediate
representation called <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_rust_ir/index.html"><code>chalk_rust_ir</code></a>. This is sort of
analogous to the <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> in Rust. The process of converting to IR is called
<em>lowering</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk/program/struct.Program.html"><code>chalk::program::Program</code></a> struct contains some &quot;rust things&quot;
but indexed and accessible in a different way. For example, if you have a
type like <code>Foo&lt;Bar&gt;</code>, we would represent <code>Foo</code> as a string in the AST but in
<code>chalk::program::Program</code>, we use numeric indices (<code>ItemId</code>).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_rust_ir/">IR source code</a> contains the complete definition.</p>

<p>Once we have Rust IR it is time to convert it to &quot;program clauses&quot;. A
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_ir/enum.ProgramClause.html"><code>ProgramClause</code></a> is essentially one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/master/GLOSSARY.md#clause">clause</a> of the form <code>consequence :- conditions</code> where <code>:-</code> is read as
&quot;if&quot; and <code>conditions = cond1 &amp;&amp; cond2 &amp;&amp; ...</code></li>
<li>A universally quantified clause of the form
<code>forall&lt;T&gt; { consequence :- conditions }</code>
<ul>
<li><code>forall&lt;T&gt; { ... }</code> is used to represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification">universal quantification</a>. See the
section on <a href="./lowering-to-logic.html#type-checking-generic-functions-beyond-horn-clauses">Lowering to logic</a> for more information.</li>
<li>A key thing to note about <code>forall</code> is that we don't allow you to &quot;quantify&quot;
over traits, only types and regions (lifetimes). That is, you can't make a
rule like <code>forall&lt;Trait&gt; { u32: Trait }</code> which would say &quot;<code>u32</code> implements
all traits&quot;. You can however say <code>forall&lt;T&gt; { T: Trait }</code> meaning &quot;<code>Trait</code>
is implemented by all types&quot;.</li>
<li><code>forall&lt;T&gt; { ... }</code> is represented in the code using the <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk_ir/struct.Binders.html"><code>Binders&lt;T&gt;</code>
struct</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See also: <a href="./goals-and-clauses.html">Goals and Clauses</a></em></p>
<p>This is where we encode the rules of the trait system into logic. For
example, if we have the following Rust:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Clone for Vec&lt;T&gt; {}
</code></pre>
<p>We generate the following program clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">forall&lt;T&gt; { (Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone) :- (T: Clone) }
</code></pre>
<p>This rule dictates that <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> is only satisfied if <code>T: Clone</code> is also
satisfied (i.e. &quot;provable&quot;).</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk/program/struct.Program.html"><code>chalk::program::Program</code></a> which has &quot;rust-like
things&quot;, chalk_ir defines <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/doc/chalk/program_environment/struct.ProgramEnvironment.html"><code>ProgramEnvironment</code></a> which which is &quot;pure logic&quot;.
The main field in that struct is <code>program_clauses</code>, which contains the

<a class="header" href="#testing" id="testing"><h2>Testing</h2></a>
<p>chalk has a test framework for lowering programs to logic, checking the
lowered logic, and performing queries on it. This is how we test the
implementation of chalk itself, and the viability of the <a href="./lowering-rules.html">lowering
rules</a>.</p>
<p>The main kind of tests in chalk are <strong>goal tests</strong>. They contain a program,
which is expected to lower to logic successfully, and a set of queries
(goals) along with the expected output. Here's an
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/4bce000801de31bf45c02f742a5fce335c9f035f/src/test.rs#L115">example</a>. Since chalk's output can be quite long, goal
tests support specifying only a prefix of the output.</p>
<p><strong>Lowering tests</strong> check the stages that occur before we can issue queries
to the solver: the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/4bce000801de31bf45c02f742a5fce335c9f035f/src/rust_ir/lowering/test.rs">lowering to chalk_rust_ir</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/4bce000801de31bf45c02f742a5fce335c9f035f/src/rules/wf/test.rs#L1">well-formedness checks</a> that occur after that.</p>
<a class="header" href="#testing-internals" id="testing-internals"><h3>Testing internals</h3></a>
<p>Goal tests use a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/4bce000801de31bf45c02f742a5fce335c9f035f/src/test.rs#L33"><code>test!</code> macro</a> that takes chalk's Rust-like

<a class="header" href="#type-checking" id="type-checking"><h1>Type checking</h1></a>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_typeck"><code>rustc_typeck</code></a> crate contains the source for &quot;type collection&quot;
and &quot;type checking&quot;, as well as a few other bits of related functionality. (It
draws heavily on the <a href="type-inference.html">type inference</a> and <a href="traits/resolution.html">trait solving</a>.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#type-collection" id="type-collection"><h2>Type collection</h2></a>
<p>Type &quot;collection&quot; is the process of converting the types found in the HIR
(<code>hir::Ty</code>), which represent the syntactic things that the user wrote, into the
<strong>internal representation</strong> used by the compiler (<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>) – we also do
similar conversions for where-clauses and other bits of the function signature.</p>
<p>To try and get a sense for the difference, consider this function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo { }
fn foo(x: Foo, y: self::Foo) { ... }
//        ^^^     ^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Those two parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> each have the same type: but they will have
distinct <code>hir::Ty</code> nodes. Those nodes will have different spans, and of course
they encode the path somewhat differently. But once they are &quot;collected&quot; into
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> nodes, they will be represented by the exact same internal type.</p>
<p>Collection is defined as a bundle of <a href="query.html">queries</a> for computing information about
the various functions, traits, and other items in the crate being compiled.
Note that each of these queries is concerned with <em>interprocedural</em> things –
for example, for a function definition, collection will figure out the type and
signature of the function, but it will not visit the <em>body</em> of the function in
any way, nor examine type annotations on local variables (that's the job of
type <em>checking</em>).</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_typeck/collect/"><code>collect</code></a> module.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: actually talk about type checking...</p>
<a class="header" href="#method-lookup" id="method-lookup"><h1>Method lookup</h1></a>
<p>Method lookup can be rather complex due to the interaction of a number
of factors, such as self types, autoderef, trait lookup, etc. This
file provides an overview of the process. More detailed notes are in
the code itself, naturally.</p>
<p>One way to think of method lookup is that we convert an expression of
the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">receiver.method(...)
</code></pre>
<p>into a more explicit <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0132-ufcs.md">UFCS</a> form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Trait::method(ADJ(receiver), ...) // for a trait call
ReceiverType::method(ADJ(receiver), ...) // for an inherent method call
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>ADJ</code> is some kind of adjustment, which is typically a series of
autoderefs and then possibly an autoref (e.g., <code>&amp;**receiver</code>). However
we sometimes do other adjustments and coercions along the way, in
particular unsizing (e.g., converting from <code>[T; n]</code> to <code>[T]</code>).</p>
<p>Method lookup is divided into two major phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Probing (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_typeck/check/method/probe/"><code>probe.rs</code></a>). The probe phase is when we decide what method
to call and how to adjust the receiver.</li>
<li>Confirmation (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_typeck/check/method/confirm/"><code>confirm.rs</code></a>). The confirmation phase &quot;applies&quot;
this selection, updating the side-tables, unifying type variables, and
otherwise doing side-effectful things.</li>
</ol>
<p>One reason for this division is to be more amenable to caching.  The
probe phase produces a &quot;pick&quot; (<code>probe::Pick</code>), which is designed to be
cacheable across method-call sites. Therefore, it does not include
inference variables or other information.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-probe-phase" id="the-probe-phase"><h2>The Probe phase</h2></a>
<a class="header" href="#steps" id="steps"><h3>Steps</h3></a>
<p>The first thing that the probe phase does is to create a series of
<em>steps</em>. This is done by progressively dereferencing the receiver type
until it cannot be deref'd anymore, as well as applying an optional
&quot;unsize&quot; step. So if the receiver has type <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code>, this
might yield:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;
Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;
[T; 3]
[T]
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#candidate-assembly-1" id="candidate-assembly-1"><h3>Candidate assembly</h3></a>
<p>We then search along those steps to create a list of <em>candidates</em>. A
<code>Candidate</code> is a method item that might plausibly be the method being
invoked. For each candidate, we'll derive a &quot;transformed self type&quot;
that takes into account explicit self.</p>
<p>Candidates are grouped into two kinds, inherent and extension.</p>
<p><strong>Inherent candidates</strong> are those that are derived from the
type of the receiver itself.  So, if you have a receiver of some
nominal type <code>Foo</code> (e.g., a struct), any methods defined within an
impl like <code>impl Foo</code> are inherent methods.  Nothing needs to be
imported to use an inherent method, they are associated with the type
itself (note that inherent impls can only be defined in the same
module as the type itself).</p>
<p>FIXME: Inherent candidates are not always derived from impls.  If you
have a trait object, such as a value of type <code>Box&lt;ToString&gt;</code>, then the
trait methods (<code>to_string()</code>, in this case) are inherently associated
with it. Another case is type parameters, in which case the methods of
their bounds are inherent. However, this part of the rules is subject
to change: when DST's &quot;impl Trait for Trait&quot; is complete, trait object
dispatch could be subsumed into trait matching, and the type parameter
behavior should be reconsidered in light of where clauses.</p>
<p>TODO: Is this FIXME still accurate?</p>
<p><strong>Extension candidates</strong> are derived from imported traits.  If I have
the trait <code>ToString</code> imported, and I call <code>to_string()</code> on a value of
type <code>T</code>, then we will go off to find out whether there is an impl of
<code>ToString</code> for <code>T</code>.  These kinds of method calls are called &quot;extension
methods&quot;.  They can be defined in any module, not only the one that
defined <code>T</code>.  Furthermore, you must import the trait to call such a
method.</p>
<p>So, let's continue our example. Imagine that we were calling a method
<code>foo</code> with the receiver <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code> and there is a trait <code>Foo</code>
that defines it with <code>&amp;self</code> for the type <code>Rc&lt;U&gt;</code> as well as a method
on the type <code>Box</code> that defines <code>Foo</code> but with <code>&amp;mut self</code>. Then we
might have two candidates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt; from the impl of `Foo` for `Rc&lt;U&gt;` where `U=Box&lt;T; 3]&gt;
&amp;mut Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt; from the inherent impl on `Box&lt;U&gt;` where `U=[T; 3]`
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#candidate-search" id="candidate-search"><h3>Candidate search</h3></a>
<p>Finally, to actually pick the method, we will search down the steps,
trying to match the receiver type against the candidate types. At
each step, we also consider an auto-ref and auto-mut-ref to see whether
that makes any of the candidates match. We pick the first step where
we find a match.</p>
<p>In the case of our example, the first step is <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code>,
which does not itself match any candidate. But when we autoref it, we
get the type <code>&amp;Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code> which does match. We would then
recursively consider all where-clauses that appear on the impl: if
those match (or we cannot rule out that they do), then this is the
method we would pick. Otherwise, we would continue down the series of
steps.</p>
<a class="header" href="#variance-of-type-and-lifetime-parameters" id="variance-of-type-and-lifetime-parameters"><h1>Variance of type and lifetime parameters</h1></a>
<p>For a more general background on variance, see the <a href="./appendix/background.html">background</a> appendix.</p>
<p>During type checking we must infer the variance of type and lifetime
parameters. The algorithm is taken from Section 4 of the paper <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/%7Eyannis/variance-extended2011.pdf">&quot;Taming the
Wildcards: Combining Definition- and Use-Site Variance&quot;</a> published in
PLDI'11 and written by Altidor et al., and hereafter referred to as The Paper.</p>
<p>This inference is explicitly designed <em>not</em> to consider the uses of
types within code. To determine the variance of type parameters
defined on type <code>X</code>, we only consider the definition of the type <code>X</code>
and the definitions of any types it references.</p>
<p>We only infer variance for type parameters found on <em>data types</em>
like structs and enums. In these cases, there is a fairly straightforward
explanation for what variance means. The variance of the type
or lifetime parameters defines whether <code>T&lt;A&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>T&lt;B&gt;</code>
(resp. <code>T&lt;'a&gt;</code> and <code>T&lt;'b&gt;</code>) based on the relationship of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>
(resp. <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>).</p>
<p>We do not infer variance for type parameters found on traits, functions,
or impls. Variance on trait parameters can indeed make sense
(and we used to compute it) but it is actually rather subtle in
meaning and not that useful in practice, so we removed it. See the
<a href="#addendum">addendum</a> for some details. Variances on function/impl parameters, on the
other hand, doesn't make sense because these parameters are instantiated and
then forgotten, they don't persist in types or compiled byproducts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notation</strong></p>
<p>We use the notation of The Paper throughout this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> is <em>covariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>-</code> is <em>contravariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>*</code> is <em>bivariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>o</code> is <em>invariance</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#the-algorithm" id="the-algorithm"><h2>The algorithm</h2></a>
<p>The basic idea is quite straightforward. We iterate over the types
defined and, for each use of a type parameter <code>X</code>, accumulate a
constraint indicating that the variance of <code>X</code> must be valid for the
variance of that use site. We then iteratively refine the variance of
<code>X</code> until all constraints are met. There is <em>always</em> a solution, because at
the limit we can declare all type parameters to be invariant and all
constraints will be satisfied.</p>
<p>As a simple example, consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">enum Option&lt;A&gt; { Some(A), None }
enum OptionalFn&lt;B&gt; { Some(|B|), None }
enum OptionalMap&lt;C&gt; { Some(|C| -&gt; C), None }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we will generate the constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">1. V(A) &lt;= +
2. V(B) &lt;= -
3. V(C) &lt;= +
4. V(C) &lt;= -
</code></pre>
<p>These indicate that (1) the variance of A must be at most covariant;
(2) the variance of B must be at most contravariant; and (3, 4) the
variance of C must be at most covariant <em>and</em> contravariant. All of these
results are based on a variance lattice defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   *      Top (bivariant)
-     +
   o      Bottom (invariant)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on this lattice, the solution <code>V(A)=+</code>, <code>V(B)=-</code>, <code>V(C)=o</code> is the
optimal solution. Note that there is always a naive solution which
just declares all variables to be invariant.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why fixed-point iteration is required. The reason
is that the variance of a use site may itself be a function of the
variance of other type parameters. In full generality, our constraints
take the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V(X) &lt;= Term
Term := + | - | * | o | V(X) | Term x Term
</code></pre>
<p>Here the notation <code>V(X)</code> indicates the variance of a type/region
parameter <code>X</code> with respect to its defining class. <code>Term x Term</code>
represents the &quot;variance transform&quot; as defined in the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the variance of a type variable <code>X</code> in type expression <code>E</code> is <code>V2</code>
and the definition-site variance of the [corresponding] type parameter
of a class <code>C</code> is <code>V1</code>, then the variance of <code>X</code> in the type expression
<code>C&lt;E&gt;</code> is <code>V3 = V1.xform(V2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#constraints" id="constraints"><h2>Constraints</h2></a>
<p>If I have a struct or enum with where clauses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo&lt;T: Bar&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>you might wonder whether the variance of <code>T</code> with respect to <code>Bar</code> affects the
variance <code>T</code> with respect to <code>Foo</code>. I claim no.  The reason: assume that <code>T</code> is
invariant with respect to <code>Bar</code> but covariant with respect to <code>Foo</code>. And then
we have a <code>Foo&lt;X&gt;</code> that is upcast to <code>Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code>, where <code>X &lt;: Y</code>. However, while
<code>X : Bar</code>, <code>Y : Bar</code> does not hold.  In that case, the upcast will be illegal,
but not because of a variance failure, but rather because the target type
<code>Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code> is itself just not well-formed. Basically we get to assume
well-formedness of all types involved before considering variance.</p>
<a class="header" href="#dependency-graph-management" id="dependency-graph-management"><h3>Dependency graph management</h3></a>
<p>Because variance is a whole-crate inference, its dependency graph
can become quite muddled if we are not careful. To resolve this, we refactor
into two queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crate_variances</code> computes the variance for all items in the current crate.</li>
<li><code>variances_of</code> accesses the variance for an individual reading; it
works by requesting <code>crate_variances</code> and extracting the relevant data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you limit yourself to reading <code>variances_of</code>, your code will only
depend then on the inference of that particular item.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this setup relies on the <a href="./queries/incremental-compilation.html">red-green algorithm</a>. In particular,
every variance query effectively depends on all type definitions in the entire
crate (through <code>crate_variances</code>), but since most changes will not result in a
change to the actual results from variance inference, the <code>variances_of</code> query
will wind up being considered green after it is re-evaluated.</p>
<p><a name="addendum"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#addendum-variance-on-traits" id="addendum-variance-on-traits"><h2>Addendum: Variance on traits</h2></a>
<p>As mentioned above, we used to permit variance on traits. This was
computed based on the appearance of trait type parameters in
method signatures and was used to represent the compatibility of
vtables in trait objects (and also &quot;virtual&quot; vtables or dictionary
in trait bounds). One complication was that variance for
associated types is less obvious, since they can be projected out
and put to myriad uses, so it's not clear when it is safe to allow
<code>X&lt;A&gt;::Bar</code> to vary (or indeed just what that means). Moreover (as
covered below) all inputs on any trait with an associated type had
to be invariant, limiting the applicability. Finally, the
annotations (<code>MarkerTrait</code>, <code>PhantomFn</code>) needed to ensure that all
trait type parameters had a variance were confusing and annoying
for little benefit.</p>
<p>Just for historical reference, I am going to preserve some text indicating how
one could interpret variance and trait matching.</p>
<a class="header" href="#variance-and-object-types" id="variance-and-object-types"><h3>Variance and object types</h3></a>
<p>Just as with structs and enums, we can decide the subtyping
relationship between two object types <code>&amp;Trait&lt;A&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;Trait&lt;B&gt;</code>
based on the relationship of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Note that for object
types we ignore the <code>Self</code> type parameter – it is unknown, and
the nature of dynamic dispatch ensures that we will always call a
function that is expected the appropriate <code>Self</code> type. However, we
must be careful with the other type parameters, or else we could
end up calling a function that is expecting one type but provided
another.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, consider a trait like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
trait ConvertTo&lt;A&gt; {
    fn convertTo(&amp;self) -&gt; A;
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Intuitively, If we had one object <code>O=&amp;ConvertTo&lt;Object&gt;</code> and another
<code>S=&amp;ConvertTo&lt;String&gt;</code>, then <code>S &lt;: O</code> because <code>String &lt;: Object</code>
(presuming Java-like &quot;string&quot; and &quot;object&quot; types, my go to examples
for subtyping). The actual algorithm would be to compare the
(explicit) type parameters pairwise respecting their variance: here,
the type parameter A is covariant (it appears only in a return
position), and hence we require that <code>String &lt;: Object</code>.</p>
<p>You'll note though that we did not consider the binding for the
(implicit) <code>Self</code> type parameter: in fact, it is unknown, so that's
good. The reason we can ignore that parameter is precisely because we
don't need to know its value until a call occurs, and at that time (as
you said) the dynamic nature of virtual dispatch means the code we run
will be correct for whatever value <code>Self</code> happens to be bound to for
the particular object whose method we called. <code>Self</code> is thus different
from <code>A</code>, because the caller requires that <code>A</code> be known in order to
know the return type of the method <code>convertTo()</code>. (As an aside, we
have rules preventing methods where <code>Self</code> appears outside of the
receiver position from being called via an object.)</p>
<a class="header" href="#trait-variance-and-vtable-resolution" id="trait-variance-and-vtable-resolution"><h3>Trait variance and vtable resolution</h3></a>
<p>But traits aren't only used with objects. They're also used when
deciding whether a given impl satisfies a given trait bound. To set the
scene here, imagine I had a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn convertAll&lt;A,T:ConvertTo&lt;A&gt;&gt;(v: &amp;[T]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine that I have an implementation of <code>ConvertTo</code> for <code>Object</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for Object { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to call <code>convertAll</code> on an array of strings. Suppose
further that for whatever reason I specifically supply the value of
<code>String</code> for the type parameter <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut vector = vec![&quot;string&quot;, ...];
convertAll::&lt;i32, String&gt;(vector);
</code></pre>
<p>Is this legal? To put another way, can we apply the <code>impl</code> for
<code>Object</code> to the type <code>String</code>? The answer is yes, but to see why
we have to expand out what will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>convertAll</code> will create a pointer to one of the entries in the
vector, which will have type <code>&amp;String</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will then call the impl of <code>convertTo()</code> that is intended
for use with objects. This has the type <code>fn(self: &amp;Object) -&gt; i32</code>.</p>
<p>It is OK to provide a value for <code>self</code> of type <code>&amp;String</code> because
<code>&amp;String &lt;: &amp;Object</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so intuitively we want this to be legal, so let's bring this back
to variance and see whether we are computing the correct result. We
must first figure out how to phrase the question &quot;is an impl for
<code>Object,i32</code> usable where an impl for <code>String,i32</code> is expected?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe it's helpful to think of a dictionary-passing implementation of
type classes. In that case, <code>convertAll()</code> takes an implicit parameter
representing the impl. In short, we <em>have</em> an impl of type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_O = ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for Object
</code></pre>
<p>and the function prototype expects an impl of type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_S = ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for String
</code></pre>
<p>As with any argument, this is legal if the type of the value given
(<code>V_O</code>) is a subtype of the type expected (<code>V_S</code>). So is <code>V_O &lt;: V_S</code>?
The answer will depend on the variance of the various parameters. In
this case, because the <code>Self</code> parameter is contravariant and <code>A</code> is
covariant, it means that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_O &lt;: V_S iff
    i32 &lt;: i32
    String &lt;: Object
</code></pre>
<p>These conditions are satisfied and so we are happy.</p>
<a class="header" href="#variance-and-associated-types" id="variance-and-associated-types"><h3>Variance and associated types</h3></a>
<p>Traits with associated types – or at minimum projection
expressions – must be invariant with respect to all of their
inputs. To see why this makes sense, consider what subtyping for a
trait reference means:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;T as Trait&gt; &lt;: &lt;U as Trait&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>means that if I know that <code>T as Trait</code>, I also know that <code>U as Trait</code>. Moreover, if you think of it as dictionary passing style,
it means that a dictionary for <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;</code> is safe to use where
a dictionary for <code>&lt;U as Trait&gt;</code> is expected.</p>
<p>The problem is that when you can project types out from <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;</code>, the relationship to types projected out of <code>&lt;U as Trait&gt;</code>
is completely unknown unless <code>T==U</code> (see #21726 for more
details). Making <code>Trait</code> invariant ensures that this is true.</p>
<p>Another related reason is that if we didn't make traits with
associated types invariant, then projection is no longer a
function with a single result. Consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Identity { type Out; fn foo(&amp;self); }
impl&lt;T&gt; Identity for T { type Out = T; ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now if I have <code>&lt;&amp;'static () as Identity&gt;::Out</code>, this can be
validly derived as <code>&amp;'a ()</code> for any <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;&amp;'a () as Identity&gt; &lt;: &lt;&amp;'static () as Identity&gt;
if &amp;'static () &lt; : &amp;'a ()   -- Identity is contravariant in Self
if 'static : 'a             -- Subtyping rules for relations
</code></pre>
<p>This change otoh means that <code>&lt;'static () as Identity&gt;::Out</code> is
always <code>&amp;'static ()</code> (which might then be upcast to <code>'a ()</code>,
separately). This was helpful in solving #21750.</p>
<a class="header" href="#existential-types" id="existential-types"><h1>Existential Types</h1></a>
<p>Existential types are essentially strong type aliases which only expose
a specific set of traits as their interface and the concrete type in the
background is inferred from a certain set of use sites of the existential
type.</p>
<p>In the language they are expressed via</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">existential type Foo: Bar;
</code></pre>
<p>This is in existential type named <code>Foo</code> which can be interacted with via
the <code>Bar</code> trait's interface.</p>
<p>Since there needs to be a concrete background type, you can currently
express that type by using the existential type in a &quot;defining use site&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Struct;
impl Bar for Struct { /* stuff */ }
fn foo() -&gt; Foo {
    Struct
}
</code></pre>
<p>Any other &quot;defining use site&quot; needs to produce the exact same type.</p>
<a class="header" href="#defining-use-sites" id="defining-use-sites"><h2>Defining use site(s)</h2></a>
<p>Currently only the return value of a function inside can

<p>The initiative for <em>&quot;not causing fatal brain damage to developers due to

<p>MIR is Rust's <em>Mid-level Intermediate Representation</em>. It is
constructed from <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a>. MIR was introduced in
<a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1211-mir.html">RFC 1211</a>. It is a radically simplified form of Rust that is used for
certain flow-sensitive safety checks – notably the borrow checker! –
and also for optimization and code generation.</p>
<p>If you'd like a very high-level introduction to MIR, as well as some
of the compiler concepts that it relies on (such as control-flow
graphs and desugaring), you may enjoy the
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">rust-lang blog post that introduced MIR</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#introduction-to-mir" id="introduction-to-mir"><h2>Introduction to MIR</h2></a>
<p>MIR is defined in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc/mir"><code>src/librustc/mir/</code></a> module, but much of the code
that manipulates it is found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_mir"><code>src/librustc_mir</code></a>.</p>
<p>Some of the key characteristics of MIR are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is based on a <a href="../appendix/background.html#cfg">control-flow graph</a>.</li>
<li>It does not have nested expressions.</li>
<li>All types in MIR are fully explicit.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#key-mir-vocabulary" id="key-mir-vocabulary"><h2>Key MIR vocabulary</h2></a>
<p>This section introduces the key concepts of MIR, summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic blocks</strong>: units of the control-flow graph, consisting of:
<ul>
<li><strong>statements:</strong> actions with one successor</li>
<li><strong>terminators:</strong> actions with potentially multiple successors; always at
the end of a block</li>
<li>(if you're not familiar with the term <em>basic block</em>, see the <a href="../appendix/background.html#cfg">background
chapter</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Locals:</strong> Memory locations allocated on the stack (conceptually, at
least), such as function arguments, local variables, and
temporaries. These are identified by an index, written with a
leading underscore, like <code>_1</code>. There is also a special &quot;local&quot;
(<code>_0</code>) allocated to store the return value.</li>
<li><strong>Places:</strong> expressions that identify a location in memory, like <code>_1</code> or
<code>_1.f</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Rvalues:</strong> expressions that produce a value. The &quot;R&quot; stands for
the fact that these are the &quot;right-hand side&quot; of an assignment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Operands:</strong> the arguments to an rvalue, which can either be a
constant (like <code>22</code>) or a place (like <code>_1</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a feeling for how MIR is structed by translating simple
programs into MIR and reading the pretty printed output. In fact, the
playground makes this easy, since it supplies a MIR button that will
show you the MIR for your program. Try putting this program into play
(or <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=30074856e62e74e91f06abd19bd72ece&amp;version=stable">clicking on this link</a>), and then clicking the &quot;MIR&quot;
button on the top:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>You should see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">// WARNING: This output format is intended for human consumers only
// and is subject to change without notice. Knock yourself out.
fn main() -&gt; () {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the MIR format for the <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Variable declarations.</strong> If we drill in a bit, we'll see it begins
with a bunch of variable declarations. They look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">let mut _0: ();                      // return place
scope 1 {
    let mut _1: std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;  // &quot;vec&quot; in scope 1 at src/main.rs:2:9: 2:16
}
scope 2 {
}
let mut _2: ();
let mut _3: &amp;mut std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;
let mut _4: ();
let mut _5: &amp;mut std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that variables in MIR don't have names, they have indices,
like <code>_0</code> or <code>_1</code>.  We also intermingle the user's variables (e.g.,
<code>_1</code>) with temporary values (e.g., <code>_2</code> or <code>_3</code>). You can tell the
difference between user-defined variables have a comment that gives
you their original name (<code>// &quot;vec&quot; in scope 1...</code>). The &quot;scope&quot; blocks
(e.g., <code>scope 1 { .. }</code>) describe the lexical structure of the source
program (which names were in scope when).</p>
<p><strong>Basic blocks.</strong> Reading further, we see our first <strong>basic block</strong> (naturally
it may look slightly different when you view it, and I am ignoring some of the
comments):</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb0: {
    StorageLive(_1);
    _1 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::new() -&gt; bb2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A basic block is defined by a series of <strong>statements</strong> and a final
<strong>terminator</strong>.  In this case, there is one statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">StorageLive(_1);
</code></pre>
<p>This statement indicates that the variable <code>_1</code> is &quot;live&quot;, meaning
that it may be used later – this will persist until we encounter a
<code>StorageDead(_1)</code> statement, which indicates that the variable <code>_1</code> is
done being used. These &quot;storage statements&quot; are used by LLVM to
allocate stack space.</p>
<p>The <strong>terminator</strong> of the block <code>bb0</code> is the call to <code>Vec::new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">_1 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::new() -&gt; bb2;
</code></pre>
<p>Terminators are different from statements because they can have more
than one successor – that is, control may flow to different
places. Function calls like the call to <code>Vec::new</code> are always
terminators because of the possibility of unwinding, although in the
case of <code>Vec::new</code> we are able to see that indeed unwinding is not
possible, and hence we list only one succssor block, <code>bb2</code>.</p>
<p>If we look ahead to <code>bb2</code>, we will see it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb2: {
    StorageLive(_3);
    _3 = &amp;mut _1;
    _2 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::push(move _3, const 1i32) -&gt; [return: bb3, unwind: bb4];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here there are two statements: another <code>StorageLive</code>, introducing the <code>_3</code>
temporary, and then an assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">_3 = &amp;mut _1;
</code></pre>
<p>Assignments in general have the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;Place&gt; = &lt;Rvalue&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A place is an expression like <code>_3</code>, <code>_3.f</code> or <code>*_3</code> – it denotes a
location in memory.  An <strong>Rvalue</strong> is an expression that creates a
value: in this case, the rvalue is a mutable borrow expression, which
looks like <code>&amp;mut &lt;Place&gt;</code>. So we can kind of define a grammar for
rvalues like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;Rvalue&gt;  = &amp; (mut)? &lt;Place&gt;
          | &lt;Operand&gt; + &lt;Operand&gt;
          | &lt;Operand&gt; - &lt;Operand&gt;
          | ...

&lt;Operand&gt; = Constant
          | copy Place
          | move Place
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from this grammar, rvalues cannot be nested – they can
only reference places and constants. Moreover, when you use a place,
we indicate whether we are <strong>copying it</strong> (which requires that the
place have a type <code>T</code> where <code>T: Copy</code>) or <strong>moving it</strong> (which works
for a place of any type). So, for example, if we had the expression <code>x = a + b + c</code> in Rust, that would get compile to two statements and a
temporary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">TMP1 = a + b
x = TMP1 + c
</code></pre>

maps in a fairly straightforward way to a Rust type.</p>
<p>The main MIR data type is <code>Mir</code>. It contains the data for a single
function (along with sub-instances of Mir for &quot;promoted constants&quot;,
but <a href="#promoted">you can read about those below</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic blocks</strong>: The basic blocks are stored in the field

we pass around <code>BasicBlock</code> values, which are
<a href="../appendix/glossary.html">newtype'd</a> indices into this vector.</li>
<li><strong>Statements</strong> are represented by the type <code>Statement</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Terminators</strong> are represented by the <code>Terminator</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Locals</strong> are represented by a <a href="../appendix/glossary.html">newtype'd</a> index type <code>Local</code>. The

the special &quot;local&quot; representing the return value.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> are identified by the enum <code>Place</code>. There are a few variants:
<ul>
<li>Local variables like <code>_1</code></li>
<li>Static variables <code>FOO</code></li>
<li><strong>Projections</strong>, which are fields or other things that &quot;project
out&quot; from a base place. So e.g. the place <code>_1.f</code> is a projection,
with <code>f</code> being the &quot;projection element and <code>_1</code> being the base
path. <code>*_1</code> is also a projection, with the <code>*</code> being represented
by the <code>ProjectionElem::Deref</code> element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rvalues</strong> are represented by the enum <code>Rvalue</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Operands</strong> are represented by the enum <code>Operand</code>.</li>

<p>The lowering of <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> to <a href="./index.html">MIR</a> occurs for the following (probably incomplete)
list of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function and Closure bodies</li>
<li>Initializers of <code>static</code> and <code>const</code> items</li>
<li>Initializers of enum discriminants</li>
<li>Glue and Shims of any kind
<ul>
<li>Tuple struct initializer functions</li>
<li>Drop code (the <code>Drop::drop</code> function is not called directly)</li>
<li>Drop implementations of types without an explicit <code>Drop</code> implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lowering is triggered by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/transform/fn.mir_built.html"><code>mir_built</code></a> query.
There is an intermediate representation
between <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> and <a href="./index.html">MIR</a> called the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/index.html">HAIR</a> that is only used during the lowering.
The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/index.html">HAIR</a>'s most important feature is that the various adjustments (which happen
without explicit syntax) like coercions, autoderef, autoref and overloaded method
calls have become explicit casts, deref operations, reference expressions or
concrete function calls.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/index.html">HAIR</a> has datatypes that mirror the <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> datatypes, but instead of e.g. <code>-x</code>
being a <code>hair::ExprKind::Neg(hair::Expr)</code> it is a <code>hair::ExprKind::Neg(hir::Expr)</code>.
This shallowness enables the <code>HAIR</code> to represent all datatypes that <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> has, but
without having to create an in-memory copy of the entire <a href="../hir.html">HIR</a>.
<a href="./index.html">MIR</a> lowering will first convert the topmost expression from
<a href="../hir.html">HIR</a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/index.html">HAIR</a> (in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/cx/expr/index.html">rustc_mir::hair::cx::expr</a>) and then process
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/hair/index.html">HAIR</a> expressions recursively.</p>
<p>The lowering creates local variables for every argument as specified in the signature.
Next it creates local variables for every binding specified (e.g. <code>(a, b): (i32, String)</code>)
produces 3 bindings, one for the argument, and two for the bindings. Next it generates
field accesses that read the fields from the argument and writes the value to the binding
variable.</p>
<p>With this initialization out of the way, the lowering triggers a recursive call
to a function that generates the MIR for the body (a <code>Block</code> expression) and
writes the result into the <code>RETURN_PLACE</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#unpack-all-the-things" id="unpack-all-the-things"><h2><code>unpack!</code> all the things</h2></a>
<p>Functions that generate MIR tend to fall into one of two patterns.
First, if the function generates only statements, then it will take a
basic block as argument onto which those statements should be appended.
It can then return a result as normal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generate_some_mir(&amp;mut self, block: BasicBlock) -&gt; ResultType {
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>But there are other functions that may generate new basic blocks as well.
For example, lowering an expression like <code>if foo { 22 } else { 44 }</code>
requires generating a small &quot;diamond-shaped graph&quot;.
In this case, the functions take a basic block where their code starts
and return a (potentially) new basic block where the code generation ends.
The <code>BlockAnd</code> type is used to represent this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generate_more_mir(&amp;mut self, block: BasicBlock) -&gt; BlockAnd&lt;ResultType&gt; {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you invoke these functions, it is common to have a local variable <code>block</code>
that is effectively a &quot;cursor&quot;. It represents the point at which we are adding new MIR.
When you invoke <code>generate_more_mir</code>, you want to update this cursor.
You can do this manually, but it's tedious:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut block;
let v = match self.generate_more_mir(..) {
    BlockAnd { block: new_block, value: v } =&gt; {
        block = new_block;
        v
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>For this reason, we offer a macro that lets you write
<code>let v = unpack!(block = self.generate_more_mir(...))</code>.
It simply extracts the new block and overwrites the
variable <code>block</code> that you named in the <code>unpack!</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lowering-expressions-into-the-desired-mir" id="lowering-expressions-into-the-desired-mir"><h2>Lowering expressions into the desired MIR</h2></a>
<p>There are essentially four kinds of representations one might want of an expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Place</code> refers to a (or part of a) preexisting memory location (local, static, promoted)</li>
<li><code>Rvalue</code> is something that can be assigned to a <code>Place</code></li>
<li><code>Operand</code> is an argument to e.g. a <code>+</code> operation or a function call</li>
<li>a temporary variable containing a copy of the value</li>
</ul>
<p>These following image depicts a general overview of the interactions between the
representations:</p>
<p><img src="mir_overview.svg"></p>
<p><a href="mir_detailed.svg">Click here for a more detailed view</a></p>
<p>We start out with lowering the function body to an <code>Rvalue</code> so we can create an
assignment to <code>RETURN_PLACE</code>, This <code>Rvalue</code> lowering will in turn trigger lowering to
<code>Operand</code> for its arguments (if any). <code>Operand</code> lowering either produces a <code>const</code>
operand, or moves/copies out of a <code>Place</code>, thus triggering a <code>Place</code> lowering. An
expression being lowered to a <code>Place</code> can in turn trigger a temporary to be created
if the expression being lowered contains operations. This is where the snake bites its
own tail and we need to trigger an <code>Rvalue</code> lowering for the expression to be written
into the local.</p>
<a class="header" href="#operator-lowering" id="operator-lowering"><h2>Operator lowering</h2></a>
<p>Operators on builtin types are not lowered to function calls (which would end up being
infinite recursion calls, because the trait impls just contain the operation itself
again). Instead there are <code>Rvalue</code>s for binary and unary operators and index operations.
These <code>Rvalue</code>s later get codegened to llvm primitive operations or llvm intrinsics.</p>
<p>Operators on all other types get lowered to a function call to their <code>impl</code> of the
operator's corresponding trait.</p>
<p>Regardless of the lowering kind, the arguments to the operator are lowered to <code>Operand</code>s.
This means all arguments are either constants, or refer to an already existing value
somewhere in a local or static.</p>
<a class="header" href="#method-call-lowering" id="method-call-lowering"><h2>Method call lowering</h2></a>
<p>Method calls are lowered to the same <code>TerminatorKind</code> that function calls are.
In <a href="./index.html">MIR</a> there is no difference between method calls and function calls anymore.</p>
<a class="header" href="#conditions" id="conditions"><h2>Conditions</h2></a>
<p><code>if</code> conditions and <code>match</code> statements for <code>enum</code>s without variants with fields are
lowered to <code>TerminatorKind::SwitchInt</code>. Each possible value (so <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>if</code>
conditions) has a corresponding <code>BasicBlock</code> to which the code continues.
The argument being branched on is (again) an <code>Operand</code> representing the value of
the if condition.</p>
<a class="header" href="#pattern-matching" id="pattern-matching"><h3>Pattern matching</h3></a>
<p><code>match</code> statements for <code>enum</code>s with variants that have fields are lowered to
<code>TerminatorKind::SwitchInt</code>, too, but the <code>Operand</code> refers to a <code>Place</code> where the
discriminant of the value can be found. This often involves reading the discriminant
to a new temporary variable.</p>
<a class="header" href="#aggregate-construction" id="aggregate-construction"><h2>Aggregate construction</h2></a>
<p>Aggregate values of any kind (e.g. structs or tuples) are built via <code>Rvalue::Aggregate</code>.
All fields are
lowered to <code>Operator</code>s. This is essentially equivalent to one assignment
statement per aggregate field plus an assignment to the discriminant in the
case of <code>enum</code>s.</p>
<a class="header" href="#mir-visitor" id="mir-visitor"><h1>MIR visitor</h1></a>
<p>The MIR visitor is a convenient tool for traversing the MIR and either
looking for things or making changes to it. The visitor traits are
defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/visit/index.html">the <code>rustc::mir::visit</code> module</a> – there are two of
them, generated via a single macro: <code>Visitor</code> (which operates on a
<code>&amp;Mir</code> and gives back shared references) and <code>MutVisitor</code> (which
operates on a <code>&amp;mut Mir</code> and gives back mutable references).</p>
<p>To implement a visitor, you have to create a type that represents
your visitor. Typically, this type wants to &quot;hang on&quot; to whatever
state you will need while processing MIR:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyVisitor&lt;...&gt; {
    tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'cx, 'tcx, 'tcx&gt;,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>and you then implement the <code>Visitor</code> or <code>MutVisitor</code> trait for that type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'tcx&gt; MutVisitor&lt;'tcx&gt; for NoLandingPads {
    fn visit_foo(&amp;mut self, ...) {
        ...
        self.super_foo(...);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As shown above, within the impl, you can override any of the
<code>visit_foo</code> methods (e.g., <code>visit_terminator</code>) in order to write some
code that will execute whenever a <code>foo</code> is found. If you want to
recursively walk the contents of the <code>foo</code>, you then invoke the
<code>super_foo</code> method. (NB. You never want to override <code>super_foo</code>.)</p>
<p>A very simple example of a visitor can be found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/transform/no_landing_pads/struct.NoLandingPads.html"><code>NoLandingPads</code></a>.
That visitor doesn't even require any state: it just visits all
terminators and removes their <code>unwind</code> successors.</p>
<a class="header" href="#traversal" id="traversal"><h2>Traversal</h2></a>
<p>In addition the visitor, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/traversal/index.html">the <code>rustc::mir::traversal</code> module</a>
contains useful functions for walking the MIR CFG in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">different standard orders</a> (e.g. pre-order, reverse
post-order, and so forth).</p>
<a class="header" href="#mir-passes" id="mir-passes"><h1>MIR passes</h1></a>
<p>If you would like to get the MIR for a function (or constant, etc),
you can use the <code>optimized_mir(def_id)</code> query. This will give you back
the final, optimized MIR. For foreign def-ids, we simply read the MIR
from the other crate's metadata. But for local def-ids, the query will
construct the MIR and then iteratively optimize it by applying a
series of passes. This section describes how those passes work and how
you can extend them.</p>
<p>To produce the <code>optimized_mir(D)</code> for a given def-id <code>D</code>, the MIR
passes through several suites of optimizations, each represented by a
query. Each suite consists of multiple optimizations and
transformations. These suites represent useful intermediate points
where we want to access the MIR for type checking or other purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mir_build(D)</code> – not a query, but this constructs the initial MIR</li>
<li><code>mir_const(D)</code> – applies some simple transformations to make MIR ready for
constant evaluation;</li>
<li><code>mir_validated(D)</code> – applies some more transformations, making MIR ready for
borrow checking;</li>
<li><code>optimized_mir(D)</code> – the final state, after all optimizations have been
performed.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#implementing-and-registering-a-pass" id="implementing-and-registering-a-pass"><h3>Implementing and registering a pass</h3></a>
<p>A <code>MirPass</code> is some bit of code that processes the MIR, typically –
but not always – transforming it along the way somehow. For example,
it might perform an optimization. The <code>MirPass</code> trait itself is found
in in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/transform/">the <code>rustc_mir::transform</code> module</a>, and it
basically consists of one method, <code>run_pass</code>, that simply gets an
<code>&amp;mut Mir</code> (along with the tcx and some information about where it
came from). The MIR is therefore modified in place (which helps to
keep things efficient).</p>
<p>A good example of a basic MIR pass is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/transform/no_landing_pads/struct.NoLandingPads.html"><code>NoLandingPads</code></a>, which walks
the MIR and removes all edges that are due to unwinding – this is
used when configured with <code>panic=abort</code>, which never unwinds. As you
can see from its source, a MIR pass is defined by first defining a
dummy type, a struct with no fields, something like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct MyPass;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>for which you then implement the <code>MirPass</code> trait. You can then insert
this pass into the appropriate list of passes found in a query like
<code>optimized_mir</code>, <code>mir_validated</code>, etc. (If this is an optimization, it
should go into the <code>optimized_mir</code> list.)</p>
<p>If you are writing a pass, there's a good chance that you are going to
want to use a <a href="./visitor.html">MIR visitor</a>. MIR visitors are a handy way to walk all
the parts of the MIR, either to search for something or to make small
edits.</p>
<a class="header" href="#stealing" id="stealing"><h3>Stealing</h3></a>
<p>The intermediate queries <code>mir_const()</code> and <code>mir_validated()</code> yield up
a <code>&amp;'tcx Steal&lt;Mir&lt;'tcx&gt;&gt;</code>, allocated using
<code>tcx.alloc_steal_mir()</code>. This indicates that the result may be
<strong>stolen</strong> by the next suite of optimizations – this is an
optimization to avoid cloning the MIR. Attempting to use a stolen
result will cause a panic in the compiler. Therefore, it is important
that you do not read directly from these intermediate queries except as
part of the MIR processing pipeline.</p>
<p>Because of this stealing mechanism, some care must also be taken to
ensure that, before the MIR at a particular phase in the processing
pipeline is stolen, anyone who may want to read from it has already
done so. Concretely, this means that if you have some query <code>foo(D)</code>
that wants to access the result of <code>mir_const(D)</code> or
<code>mir_validated(D)</code>, you need to have the successor pass &quot;force&quot;
<code>foo(D)</code> using <code>ty::queries::foo::force(...)</code>. This will force a query
to execute even though you don't directly require its result.</p>
<p>As an example, consider MIR const qualification. It wants to read the
result produced by the <code>mir_const()</code> suite. However, that result will
be <strong>stolen</strong> by the <code>mir_validated()</code> suite. If nothing was done,
then <code>mir_const_qualif(D)</code> would succeed if it came before
<code>mir_validated(D)</code>, but fail otherwise. Therefore, <code>mir_validated(D)</code>
will <strong>force</strong> <code>mir_const_qualif</code> before it actually steals, thus
ensuring that the reads have already happened (remember that
<a href="../query.html">queries are memoized</a>, so executing a query twice
simply loads from a cache the second time):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">mir_const(D) --read-by--&gt; mir_const_qualif(D)
     |                       ^
  stolen-by                  |
     |                    (forces)
     v                       |
mir_validated(D) ------------+
</code></pre>
<p>This mechanism is a bit dodgy. There is a discussion of more elegant
alternatives in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41710">rust-lang/rust#41710</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>-Zdump-mir</code> flag can be used to dump a text representation of the MIR. The
<code>-Zdump-mir-graphviz</code> flag can be used to dump a <code>.dot</code> file that represents
MIR as a control-flow graph.</p>
<p><code>-Zdump-mir=F</code> is a handy compiler options that will let you view the MIR for
each function at each stage of compilation. <code>-Zdump-mir</code> takes a <strong>filter</strong> <code>F</code>
which allows you to control which functions and which passes you are
interesting in. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc -Zdump-mir=foo ...
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump the MIR for any function whose name contains <code>foo</code>; it
will dump the MIR both before and after every pass. Those files will
be created in the <code>mir_dump</code> directory. There will likely be quite a
lot of them!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cat &gt; foo.rs
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
^D
&gt; rustc -Zdump-mir=main foo.rs
&gt; ls mir_dump/* | wc -l
     161
</code></pre>
<p>The files have names like <code>rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir</code>. These
names have a number of parts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir
      ---- --- --- --------------- ----- either before or after
      |    |   |   name of the pass
      |    |   index of dump within the pass (usually 0, but some passes dump intermediate states)
      |    index of the pass
      def-path to the function etc being dumped
</code></pre>
<p>You can also make more selective filters. For example, <code>main &amp; CleanEndRegions</code>
will select for things that reference <em>both</em> <code>main</code> and the pass
<code>CleanEndRegions</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc -Zdump-mir='main &amp; CleanEndRegions' foo.rs
&gt; ls mir_dump
rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir	rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.before.mir
</code></pre>
<p>Filters can also have <code>|</code> parts to combine multiple sets of
<code>&amp;</code>-filters. For example <code>main &amp; CleanEndRegions | main &amp; NoLandingPads</code> will select <em>either</em> <code>main</code> and <code>CleanEndRegions</code> <em>or</em>
<code>main</code> and <code>NoLandingPads</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc -Zdump-mir='main &amp; CleanEndRegions | main &amp; NoLandingPads' foo.rs

<p>TODO: anything else?</p>
<a class="header" href="#mir-borrow-check" id="mir-borrow-check"><h1>MIR borrow check</h1></a>
<p>The borrow check is Rust's &quot;secret sauce&quot; – it is tasked with
enforcing a number of properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>That all variables are initialized before they are used.</li>
<li>That you can't move the same value twice.</li>
<li>That you can't move a value while it is borrowed.</li>
<li>That you can't access a place while it is mutably borrowed (except through
the reference).</li>
<li>That you can't mutate a place while it is shared borrowed.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of this writing, the code is in a state of transition. The
&quot;main&quot; borrow checker still works by processing <a href="hir.html">the HIR</a>,
but that is being phased out in favor of the MIR-based borrow checker.
Accordingly, this documentation focuses on the new, MIR-based borrow
checker.</p>
<p>Doing borrow checking on MIR has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MIR is <em>far</em> less complex than the HIR; the radical desugaring
helps prevent bugs in the borrow checker. (If you're curious, you
can see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47366">a list of bugs that the MIR-based borrow checker fixes here</a>.)</li>
<li>Even more importantly, using the MIR enables <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2094-nll.html">&quot;non-lexical lifetimes&quot;</a>,
which are regions derived from the control-flow graph.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#major-phases-of-the-borrow-checker" id="major-phases-of-the-borrow-checker"><h3>Major phases of the borrow checker</h3></a>
<p>The borrow checker source is found in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/index.html">the <code>rustc_mir::borrow_check</code> module</a>. The main entry point is
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/fn.mir_borrowck.html"><code>mir_borrowck</code></a> query.</p>
<ul>
<li>We first create a <strong>local copy</strong> of the MIR. In the coming steps,
we will modify this copy in place to modify the types and things to
include references to the new regions that we are computing.</li>
<li>We then invoke <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a> to modify our local MIR.
Among other things, this function will replace all of the <a href="./appendix/glossary.html">regions</a> in
the MIR with fresh <a href="./appendix/glossary.html">inference variables</a>.</li>
<li>Next, we perform a number of
<a href="./appendix/background.html#dataflow">dataflow analyses</a> that
compute what data is moved and when.</li>
<li>We then do a <a href="borrow_check/type_check.html">second type check</a> across the MIR:
the purpose of this type check is to determine all of the constraints between
different regions.</li>
<li>Next, we do <a href="borrow_check/region_inference.html">region inference</a>, which computes
the values of each region — basically, the points in the control-flow graph where
each lifetime must be valid according to the constraints we collected.</li>
<li>At this point, we can compute the &quot;borrows in scope&quot; at each point.</li>
<li>Finally, we do a second walk over the MIR, looking at the actions it
does and reporting errors. For example, if we see a statement like
<code>*a + 1</code>, then we would check that the variable <code>a</code> is initialized
and that it is not mutably borrowed, as either of those would
require an error to be reported. Doing this check requires the results of all
the previous analyses.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#tracking-moves-and-initialization" id="tracking-moves-and-initialization"><h1>Tracking moves and initialization</h1></a>
<p>Part of the borrow checker's job is to track which variables are
&quot;initialized&quot; at any given point in time -- this also requires
figuring out where moves occur and tracking those.</p>
<a class="header" href="#initialization-and-moves" id="initialization-and-moves"><h2>Initialization and moves</h2></a>
<p>From a user's perspective, initialization -- giving a variable some
value -- and moves -- transfering ownership to another place -- might
seem like distinct topics. Indeed, our borrow checker error messages
often talk about them differently. But <strong>within the borrow checker</strong>,
they are not nearly as separate. Roughly speaking, the borrow checker
tracks the set of &quot;initialized places&quot; at any point in the source
code. Assigning to a previously uninitialized local variable adds it
to that set; moving from a local variable removes it from that set.</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() {
    let a: Vec&lt;u32&gt;;
    
    // a is not initialized yet
    
    a = vec![22];
    
    // a is initialized here
    
    std::mem::drop(a); // a is moved here
    
    // a is no longer initialized here

    let l = a.len(); //~ ERROR
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see that <code>a</code> starts off as uninitialized; once it is
assigned, it becomes initialized. But when <code>drop(a)</code> is called, that
moves <code>a</code> into the call, and hence it becomes uninitialized again.</p>
<a class="header" href="#subsections" id="subsections"><h2>Subsections</h2></a>
<p>To make it easier to peruse, this section is broken into a number of
subsections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./moves_and_initialization/move_paths.html">Move paths</a> the
<em>move path</em> concept that we use to track which local variables (or parts of
local variables, in some cases) are initialized.</li>
<li>TODO <em>Rest not yet written</em> =)</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#move-paths" id="move-paths"><h1>Move paths</h1></a>
<p>In reality, it's not enough to track initialization at the granularity
of local variables. Rust also allows us to do moves and initialization
at the field granularity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() {
    let a: (Vec&lt;u32&gt;, Vec&lt;u32&gt;) = (vec![22], vec![44]);
    
    // a.0 and a.1 are both initialized
    
    let b = a.0; // moves a.0
    
    // a.0 is not initializd, but a.1 still is

    let c = a.0; // ERROR
    let d = a.1; // OK
}
</code></pre>
<p>To handle this, we track initialization at the granularity of a <strong>move
path</strong>. A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html"><code>MovePath</code></a> represents some location that the user can
initialize, move, etc. So e.g. there is a move-path representing the
local variable <code>a</code>, and there is a move-path representing <code>a.0</code>.  Move
paths roughly correspond to the concept of a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> from MIR, but
they are indexed in ways that enable us to do move analysis more
efficiently.</p>
<a class="header" href="#move-path-indices" id="move-path-indices"><h2>Move path indices</h2></a>
<p>Although there is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html"><code>MovePath</code></a> data structure, they are never referenced
directly.  Instead, all the code passes around <em>indices</em> of type
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. If you need to get information about a move path, you use
this index with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#structfield.move_paths"><code>move_paths</code> field of the <code>MoveData</code></a>. For
example, to convert a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> <code>mpi</code> into a MIR <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, you might
access the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html#structfield.place"><code>MovePath::place</code></a> field like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">move_data.move_paths[mpi].place
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#building-move-paths" id="building-move-paths"><h2>Building move paths</h2></a>
<p>One of the first things we do in the MIR borrow check is to construct
the set of move paths. This is done as part of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#method.gather_moves"><code>MoveData::gather_moves</code></a> function. This function uses a MIR visitor
called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/builder/struct.Gatherer.html"><code>Gatherer</code></a> to walk the MIR and look at how each <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>
within is accessed. For each such <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, it constructs a
corresponding <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. It also records when/where that
particular move path is moved/initialized, but we'll get to that in a
later section.</p>
<a class="header" href="#illegal-move-paths" id="illegal-move-paths"><h3>Illegal move paths</h3></a>
<p>We don't actually create a move-path for <strong>every</strong> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> that gets
used.  In particular, if it is illegal to move from a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, then
there is no need for a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot move from a static variable, so we do not create a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>
for static variables.</li>
<li>You cannot move an individual element of an array, so if we have e.g. <code>foo: [String; 3]</code>,
there would be no move-path for <code>foo[1]</code>.</li>
<li>You cannot move from inside of a borrowed reference, so if we have e.g. <code>foo: &amp;String</code>,
there would be no move-path for <code>*foo</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are enforced by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/builder/struct.Gatherer.html#method.move_path_for"><code>move_path_for</code></a> function, which
converts a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> into a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> -- in error cases like
those just discussed, the function returns an <code>Err</code>. This in turn
means we don't have to bother tracking whether those places are
initialized (which lowers overhead).</p>
<a class="header" href="#looking-up-a-move-path" id="looking-up-a-move-path"><h2>Looking up a move-path</h2></a>
<p>If you have a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> and you would like to convert it to a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>, you
can do that using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html"><code>MovePathLookup</code></a> structure found in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#structfield.rev_lookup"><code>rev_lookup</code></a> field
of [<code>MoveData</code>]. There are two different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find_local"><code>find_local</code></a>, which takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/struct.Local.html"><code>mir::Local</code></a> representing a local
variable. This is the easier method, because we <strong>always</strong> create a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for every local variable.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find"><code>find</code></a>, which takes an arbitrary <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>. This method is a bit
more annoying to use, precisely because we don't have a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for <strong>every</strong> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/mir/enum.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> (as we just discussed in
the &quot;illegal move paths&quot; section). Therefore, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find"><code>find</code></a> returns a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/enum.LookupResult.html"><code>LookupResult</code></a> indicating the closest path it was able to find
that exists (e.g., for <code>foo[1]</code>, it might return just the path for
<code>foo</code>).</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#cross-references" id="cross-references"><h2>Cross-references</h2></a>
<p>As we noted above, move-paths are stored in a big vector and
referenced via their <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. However, within this vector,
they are also structured into a tree. So for example if you have the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for <code>a.b.c</code>, you can go to its parent move-path
<code>a.b</code>. You can also iterate over all children paths: so, from <code>a.b</code>,
you might iterate to find the path <code>a.b.c</code> (here you are iterating
just over the paths that are <strong>actually referenced</strong> in the source,
not all <strong>possible</strong> paths that could have been referenced). These
references are used for example in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/dataflow/at_location/struct.FlowAtLocation.html#method.has_any_child_of"><code>has_any_child_of</code></a> function,
which checks whether the dataflow results contain a value for the
given move-path (e.g., <code>a.b</code>) or any child of that move-path (e.g.,
<code>a.b.c</code>).</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-mir-type-check" id="the-mir-type-check"><h1>The MIR type-check</h1></a>
<p>A key component of the borrow check is the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/type_check/index.html">MIR type-check</a>.
This check walks the MIR and does a complete &quot;type check&quot; -- the same
kind you might find in any other language. In the process of doing
this type-check, we also uncover the region constraints that apply to
the program.</p>
<p>TODO -- elaborate further? Maybe? :)</p>
<a class="header" href="#region-inference-nll" id="region-inference-nll"><h1>Region inference (NLL)</h1></a>
<p>The MIR-based region checking code is located in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/index.html">the <code>rustc_mir::borrow_check::nll</code> module</a>. (NLL, of course,
stands for &quot;non-lexical lifetimes&quot;, a term that will hopefully be
deprecated once they become the standard kind of lifetime.)</p>
<p>The MIR-based region analysis consists of two major functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a>, invoked first, has two jobs:
<ul>
<li>First, it finds the set of regions that appear within the
signature of the function (e.g., <code>'a</code> in <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a u32) { ... }</code>). These are called the &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;free&quot; regions – in
particular, they are the regions that <a href="../appendix/background.html#free-vs-bound">appear free</a> in the
function body.</li>
<li>Second, it replaces all the regions from the function body with
fresh inference variables. This is because (presently) those
regions are the results of lexical region inference and hence are
not of much interest. The intention is that – eventually – they
will be &quot;erased regions&quot; (i.e., no information at all), since we
won't be doing lexical region inference at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/fn.compute_regions.html"><code>compute_regions</code></a>, invoked second: this is given as argument the
results of move analysis. It has the job of computing values for all
the inference variables that <code>replace_regions_in_mir</code> introduced.
<ul>
<li>To do that, it first runs the <a href="borrow_check/./type_check.html">MIR type checker</a>. This
is basically a normal type-checker but specialized to MIR, which
is much simpler than full Rust, of course. Running the MIR type
checker will however create <strong>outlives constraints</strong> between
region variables (e.g., that one variable must outlive another
one) to reflect the subtyping relationships that arise.</li>
<li>It also adds <strong>liveness constraints</strong> that arise from where variables
are used.</li>
<li>After this, we create a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html"><code>RegionInferenceContext</code></a> with the constraints we
have computed and the inference variables we introduced and use the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.solve"><code>solve</code></a> method to infer values for all region inference varaibles.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2094-nll.html">NLL RFC</a> also includes fairly thorough (and hopefully readable)
coverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#universal-regions" id="universal-regions"><h2>Universal regions</h2></a>
<p>The [<code>UnversalRegions</code>] type represents a collection of <em>universal</em> regions
corresponding to some MIR <code>DefId</code>. It is constructed in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a> when we replace all regions with fresh inference
variables. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/universal_regions/struct.UniversalRegions.html"><code>UniversalRegions</code></a> contains indices for all the free regions in
the given MIR along with any relationships that are <em>known</em> to hold between
them (e.g. implied bounds, where clauses, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, given the MIR for the following function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32) {
    // ...
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>we would create a universal region for <code>'a</code> and one for <code>'static</code>. There may
also be some complications for handling closures, but we will ignore those for
the moment.</p>
<p>TODO: write about <em>how</em> these regions are computed.</p>
<a class="header" href="#region-variables" id="region-variables"><h2>Region variables</h2></a>
<p>The value of a region can be thought of as a <strong>set</strong>. This set contains all
points in the MIR where the region is valid along with any regions that are
outlived by this region (e.g. if <code>'a: 'b</code>, then <code>end('b)</code> is in the set for
<code>'a</code>); we call the domain of this set a <code>RegionElement</code>. In the code, the value
for all regions is maintained in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/">the
<code>rustc_mir::borrow_check::nll::region_infer</code> module</a>. For each region we
maintain a set storing what elements are present in its value (to make this
efficient, we give each kind of element an index, the <code>RegionElementIndex</code>, and
use sparse bitsets).</p>
<p>The kinds of region elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>location</strong> in the MIR control-flow graph: a location is just
the pair of a basic block and an index. This identifies the point
<strong>on entry</strong> to the statement with that index (or the terminator, if
the index is equal to <code>statements.len()</code>).</li>
<li>There is an element <code>end('a)</code> for each universal region <code>'a</code>,
corresponding to some portion of the caller's (or caller's caller,
etc) control-flow graph.</li>
<li>Similarly, there is an element denoted <code>end('static)</code> corresponding
to the remainder of program execution after this function returns.</li>
<li>There is an element <code>!1</code> for each placeholder region <code>!1</code>. This
corresponds (intuitively) to some unknown set of other elements –
for details on placeholders, see the section
<a href="#placeholder">placeholders and universes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#constraints-1" id="constraints-1"><h2>Constraints</h2></a>
<p>Before we can infer the value of regions, we need to collect constraints on the
regions. There are two primary types of constraints.</p>
<ol>
<li>Outlives constraints. These are constraints that one region outlives another
(e.g. <code>'a: 'b</code>). Outlives constraints are generated by the <a href="borrow_check/./type_check.html">MIR type
checker</a>.</li>
<li>Liveness constraints. Each region needs to be live at points where it can be
used. These constraints are collected by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/constraint_generation/fn.generate_constraints.html"><code>generate_constraints</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="#inference-overview" id="inference-overview"><h2>Inference Overview</h2></a>
<p>So how do we compute the contents of a region? This process is called <em>region
inference</em>. The high-level idea is pretty simple, but there are some details we
need to take care of.</p>
<p>Here is the high-level idea: we start off each region with the MIR locations we
know must be in it from the liveness constraints. From there, we use all of the
outlives constraints computed from the type checker to <em>propagate</em> the
constraints: for each region <code>'a</code>, if <code>'a: 'b</code>, then we add all elements of
<code>'b</code> to <code>'a</code>, including <code>end('b)</code>. This all happens in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.propagate_constraints"><code>propagate_constraints</code></a>.</p>
<p>Then, we will check for errors. We first check that type tests are satisfied by
calling <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.check_type_tests"><code>check_type_tests</code></a>. This checks constraints like <code>T: 'a</code>. Second, we
check that universal regions are not &quot;too big&quot;. This is done by calling
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.check_universal_regions"><code>check_universal_regions</code></a>. This checks that for each region <code>'a</code> if <code>'a</code>
contains the element <code>end('b)</code>, then we must already know that <code>'a: 'b</code> holds
(e.g. from a where clause). If we don't already know this, that is an error...
well, almost. There is some special handling for closures that we will discuss
later.</p>
<a class="header" href="#example-1" id="example-1"><h3>Example</h3></a>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a usize) -&gt; &amp;'b usize {
    x
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, this should not compile because we don't know if <code>'a</code> outlives <code>'b</code>
(if it doesn't then the return value could be a dangling reference).</p>
<p>Let's back up a bit. We need to introduce some free inference variables (as is
done in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a>). This example doesn't use the exact regions
produced, but it (hopefully) is enough to get the idea across.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a /* '#1 */ usize) -&gt; &amp;'b /* '#3 */ usize {
    x // '#2, location L1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some notation: <code>'#1</code>, <code>'#3</code>, and <code>'#2</code> represent the universal regions for the
argument, return value, and the expression <code>x</code>, respectively. Additionally, I
will call the location of the expression <code>x</code> <code>L1</code>.</p>
<p>So now we can use the liveness constraints to get the following starting points:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Region  </th><th> Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1     </td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2     </td><td> <code>L1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3     </td><td> <code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Now we use the outlives constraints to expand each region. Specifically, we
know that <code>'#2: '#3</code> ...</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Region  </th><th> Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1     </td><td> <code>L1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2     </td><td> <code>L1, end('#3) // add contents of '#3 and end('#3)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3     </td><td> <code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>... and <code>'#1: '#2</code>, so ...</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Region  </th><th> Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1     </td><td> <code>L1, end('#2), end('#3) // add contents of '#2 and end('#2)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2     </td><td> <code>L1, end('#3)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3     </td><td> <code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Now, we need to check that no regions were too big (we don't have any type
tests to check in this case). Notice that <code>'#1</code> now contains <code>end('#3)</code>, but
we have no <code>where</code> clause or implied bound to say that <code>'a: 'b</code>... that's an
error!</p>
<a class="header" href="#some-details" id="some-details"><h3>Some details</h3></a>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html"><code>RegionInferenceContext</code></a> type contains all of the information needed to

<p>TODO: should we discuss any of the others fields? What about the SCCs?</p>
<p>Ok, now that we have constructed a <code>RegionInferenceContext</code>, we can do
inference. This is done by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/borrow_check/nll/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.solve"><code>solve</code></a> method on the context. This

tests and universal regions, as discussed above.</p>
<a class="header" href="#closures" id="closures"><h2>Closures</h2></a>
<p>When we are checking the type tests and universal regions, we may come across a
constraint that we can't prove yet if we are in a closure body! However, the
necessary constraints may actually hold (we just don't know it yet). Thus, if
we are inside a closure, we just collect all the constraints we can't prove yet
and return them. Later, when we are borrow check the MIR node that created the
closure, we can also check that these constraints hold. At that time, if we
can't prove they hold, we report an error.</p>

<p>(This section describes ongoing work that hasn't landed yet.)</p>
<p>From time to time we have to reason about regions that we can't
concretely know. For example, consider this program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// A function that needs a static reference
fn foo(x: &amp;'static u32) { }

fn bar(f: for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)) {
       // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a function that can accept **any** reference
    let x = 22;
    f(&amp;x);
}

fn main() {
    bar(foo);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This program ought not to type-check: <code>foo</code> needs a static reference
for its argument, and <code>bar</code> wants to be given a function that that
accepts <strong>any</strong> reference (so it can call it with something on its
stack, for example). But <em>how</em> do we reject it and <em>why</em>?</p>
<a class="header" href="#subtyping-and-placeholders" id="subtyping-and-placeholders"><h3>Subtyping and Placeholders</h3></a>
<p>When we type-check <code>main</code>, and in particular the call <code>bar(foo)</code>, we
are going to wind up with a subtyping relationship like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)
----------------    -------------------
the type of `foo`   the type `bar` expects
</code></pre>
<p>We handle this sort of subtyping by taking the variables that are
bound in the supertype and replacing them with
<a href="../appendix/background.html#quantified">universally quantified</a>
representatives, written like <code>!1</code>. We call these regions &quot;placeholder
regions&quot; – they represent, basically, &quot;some unknown region&quot;.</p>
<p>Once we've done that replacement, we have the following relation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: fn(&amp;'!1 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>The key idea here is that this unknown region <code>'!1</code> is not related to
any other regions. So if we can prove that the subtyping relationship
is true for <code>'!1</code>, then it ought to be true for any region, which is
what we wanted.</p>
<p>So let's work through what happens next. To check if two functions are
subtypes, we check if their arguments have the desired relationship
(fn arguments are <a href="../appendix/background.html#variance">contravariant</a>, so
we swap the left and right here):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'static u32
</code></pre>
<p>According to the basic subtyping rules for a reference, this will be
true if <code>'!1: 'static</code>. That is – if &quot;some unknown region <code>!1</code>&quot; lives
outlives <code>'static</code>. Now, this <em>might</em> be true – after all, <code>'!1</code>
could be <code>'static</code> – but we don't <em>know</em> that it's true. So this
should yield up an error (eventually).</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-a-universe" id="what-is-a-universe"><h3>What is a universe</h3></a>
<p>In the previous section, we introduced the idea of a placeholder
region, and we denoted it <code>!1</code>. We call this number <code>1</code> the <strong>universe
index</strong>. The idea of a &quot;universe&quot; is that it is a set of names that
are in scope within some type or at some point. Universes are formed
into a tree, where each child extends its parents with some new names.
So the <strong>root universe</strong> conceptually contains global names, such as
the the lifetime <code>'static</code> or the type <code>i32</code>. In the compiler, we also
put generic type parameters into this root universe (in this sense,
there is not just one root universe, but one per item). So consider
this function <code>bar</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo { }

fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the root universe would consist of the lifetimes <code>'static</code> and
<code>'a</code>.  In fact, although we're focused on lifetimes here, we can apply
the same concept to types, in which case the types <code>Foo</code> and <code>T</code> would
be in the root universe (along with other global types, like <code>i32</code>).
Basically, the root universe contains all the names that
<a href="../appendix/background.html#free-vs-bound">appear free</a> in the body of <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's extend <code>bar</code> a bit by adding a variable <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    let x: for&lt;'b&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32) = ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the name <code>'b</code> is not part of the root universe. Instead, when we
&quot;enter&quot; into this <code>for&lt;'b&gt;</code> (e.g., by replacing it with a placeholder), we will create
a child universe of the root, let's call it U1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">U0 (root universe)
│
└─ U1 (child universe)
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that this child universe U1 extends the root universe U0
with a new name, which we are identifying by its universe number:
<code>!1</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's extend <code>bar</code> a bit by adding one more variable, <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    let x: for&lt;'b&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32) = ...;
    let y: for&lt;'c&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32) = ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we enter <em>this</em> type, we will again create a new universe, which
we'll call <code>U2</code>. Its parent will be the root universe, and U1 will be
its sibling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">U0 (root universe)
│
├─ U1 (child universe)
│
└─ U2 (child universe)
</code></pre>
<p>This implies that, while in U2, we can name things from U0 or U2, but
not U1.</p>
<p><strong>Giving existential variables a universe.</strong> Now that we have this
notion of universes, we can use it to extend our type-checker and
things to prevent illegal names from leaking out. The idea is that we
give each inference (existential) variable – whether it be a type or
a lifetime – a universe. That variable's value can then only
reference names visible from that universe. So for example is a
lifetime variable is created in U0, then it cannot be assigned a value
of <code>!1</code> or <code>!2</code>, because those names are not visible from the universe
U0.</p>
<p><strong>Representing universes with just a counter.</strong> You might be surprised
to see that the compiler doesn't keep track of a full tree of
universes. Instead, it just keeps a counter – and, to determine if
one universe can see another one, it just checks if the index is
greater. For example, U2 can see U0 because 2 &gt;= 0. But U0 cannot see
U2, because 0 &gt;= 2 is false.</p>
<p>How can we get away with this? Doesn't this mean that we would allow
U2 to also see U1? The answer is that, yes, we would, <strong>if that
question ever arose</strong>.  But because of the structure of our type
checker etc, there is no way for that to happen. In order for
something happening in the universe U1 to &quot;communicate&quot; with something
happening in U2, they would have to have a shared inference variable X
in common. And because everything in U1 is scoped to just U1 and its
children, that inference variable X would have to be in U0. And since
X is in U0, it cannot name anything from U1 (or U2). This is perhaps easiest
to see by using a kind of generic &quot;logic&quot; example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">exists&lt;X&gt; {
   forall&lt;Y&gt; { ... /* Y is in U1 ... */ }
   forall&lt;Z&gt; { ... /* Z is in U2 ... */ }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the only way for the two foralls to interact would be through X,
but neither Y nor Z are in scope when X is declared, so its value
cannot reference either of them.</p>
<a class="header" href="#universes-and-placeholder-region-elements" id="universes-and-placeholder-region-elements"><h3>Universes and placeholder region elements</h3></a>
<p>But where does that error come from?  The way it happens is like this.
When we are constructing the region inference context, we can tell
from the type inference context how many placeholder variables exist
(the <code>InferCtxt</code> has an internal counter). For each of those, we
create a corresponding universal region variable <code>!n</code> and a &quot;region
element&quot; <code>placeholder(n)</code>. This corresponds to &quot;some unknown set of other
elements&quot;. The value of <code>!n</code> is <code>{placeholder(n)}</code>.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also give each existential variable a
<strong>universe</strong> (also taken from the <code>InferCtxt</code>). This universe
determines which placeholder elements may appear in its value: For
example, a variable in universe U3 may name <code>placeholder(1)</code>, <code>placeholder(2)</code>, and
<code>placeholder(3)</code>, but not <code>placeholder(4)</code>. Note that the universe of an inference
variable controls what region elements <strong>can</strong> appear in its value; it
does not say region elements <strong>will</strong> appear.</p>
<a class="header" href="#placeholders-and-outlives-constraints" id="placeholders-and-outlives-constraints"><h3>Placeholders and outlives constraints</h3></a>
<p>In the region inference engine, outlives constraints have the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1: V2 @ P
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>V1</code> and <code>V2</code> are region indices, and hence map to some region
variable (which may be universally or existentially quantified). The
<code>P</code> here is a &quot;point&quot; in the control-flow graph; it's not important
for this section. This variable will have a universe, so let's call
those universes <code>U(V1)</code> and <code>U(V2)</code> respectively. (Actually, the only
one we are going to care about is <code>U(V1)</code>.)</p>
<p>When we encounter this constraint, the ordinary procedure is to start
a DFS from <code>P</code>. We keep walking so long as the nodes we are walking
are present in <code>value(V2)</code> and we add those nodes to <code>value(V1)</code>. If
we reach a return point, we add in any <code>end(X)</code> elements. That part
remains unchanged.</p>
<p>But then <em>after that</em> we want to iterate over the placeholder <code>placeholder(x)</code>
elements in V2 (each of those must be visible to <code>U(V2)</code>, but we
should be able to just assume that is true, we don't have to check
it). We have to ensure that <code>value(V1)</code> outlives each of those
placeholder elements.</p>
<p>Now there are two ways that could happen. First, if <code>U(V1)</code> can see
the universe <code>x</code> (i.e., <code>x &lt;= U(V1)</code>), then we can just add <code>placeholder(x)</code>
to <code>value(V1)</code> and be done. But if not, then we have to approximate:
we may not know what set of elements <code>placeholder(x)</code> represents, but we
should be able to compute some sort of <strong>upper bound</strong> B for it –
some region B that outlives <code>placeholder(x)</code>. For now, we'll just use
<code>'static</code> for that (since it outlives everything) – in the future, we
can sometimes be smarter here (and in fact we have code for doing this
already in other contexts). Moreover, since <code>'static</code> is in the root
universe U0, we know that all variables can see it – so basically if
we find that <code>value(V2)</code> contains <code>placeholder(x)</code> for some universe <code>x</code>
that <code>V1</code> can't see, then we force <code>V1</code> to <code>'static</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#extending-the-universal-regions-check" id="extending-the-universal-regions-check"><h3>Extending the &quot;universal regions&quot; check</h3></a>
<p>After all constraints have been propagated, the NLL region inference
has one final check, where it goes over the values that wound up being
computed for each universal region and checks that they did not get
'too large'. In our case, we will go through each placeholder region
and check that it contains <em>only</em> the <code>placeholder(u)</code> element it is known to
outlive. (Later, we might be able to know that there are relationships
between two placeholder regions and take those into account, as we do
for universal regions from the fn signature.)</p>
<p>Put another way, the &quot;universal regions&quot; check can be considered to be
checking constraints like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{placeholder(1)}: V1
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>{placeholder(1)}</code> is like a constant set, and V1 is the variable we
made to represent the <code>!1</code> region.</p>
<a class="header" href="#back-to-our-example" id="back-to-our-example"><h2>Back to our example</h2></a>
<p>OK, so far so good. Now let's walk through what would happen with our
first example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: fn(&amp;'!1 u32) @ P  // this point P is not imp't here
</code></pre>
<p>The region inference engine will create a region element domain like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{ CFG; end('static); placeholder(1) }
    ---  ------------  ------- from the universe `!1`
    |    'static is always in scope
    all points in the CFG; not especially relevant here
</code></pre>
<p>It will always create two universal variables, one representing
<code>'static</code> and one representing <code>'!1</code>. Let's call them Vs and V1. They
will have initial values like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vs = { CFG; end('static) } // it is in U0, so can't name anything else
V1 = { placeholder(1) }
</code></pre>
<p>From the subtyping constraint above, we would have an outlives constraint like</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'!1: 'static @ P
</code></pre>
<p>To process this, we would grow the value of V1 to include all of Vs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vs = { CFG; end('static) }
V1 = { CFG; end('static), placeholder(1) }
</code></pre>
<p>At that point, constraint propagation is complete, because all the
outlives relationships are satisfied. Then we would go to the &quot;check
universal regions&quot; portion of the code, which would test that no
universal region grew too large.</p>
<p>In this case, <code>V1</code> <em>did</em> grow too large – it is not known to outlive
<code>end('static)</code>, nor any of the CFG – so we would report an error.</p>
<a class="header" href="#another-example" id="another-example"><h2>Another example</h2></a>
<p>What about this subtyping relationship?</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32)
    &lt;:
for&lt;'b, 'c&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32, &amp;'c u32)
</code></pre>
<p>Here we would replace the bound region in the supertype with a placeholder, as before, yielding:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32)
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>then we instantiate the variable on the left-hand side with an
existential in universe U2, yielding the following (<code>?n</code> is a notation
for an existential variable):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'?3 u32, &amp;'?3 u32)
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we break this down further:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32
&amp;'!2 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32
</code></pre>
<p>and even further, yield up our region constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'!1: '?3
'!2: '?3
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in this case, both <code>'!1</code> and <code>'!2</code> have to outlive the
variable <code>'?3</code>, but the variable <code>'?3</code> is not forced to outlive
anything else. Therefore, it simply starts and ends as the empty set
of elements, and hence the type-check succeeds here.</p>
<p>(This should surprise you a little. It surprised me when I first realized it.
We are saying that if we are a fn that <strong>needs both of its arguments to have
the same region</strong>, we can accept being called with <strong>arguments with two
distinct regions</strong>. That seems intuitively unsound. But in fact, it's fine, as
I tried to explain in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32330#issuecomment-202536977">this issue</a> on the Rust issue
tracker long ago.  The reason is that even if we get called with arguments of
two distinct lifetimes, those two lifetimes have some intersection (the call
itself), and that intersection can be our value of <code>'a</code> that we use as the
common lifetime of our arguments. -nmatsakis)</p>
<a class="header" href="#final-example" id="final-example"><h2>Final example</h2></a>
<p>Let's look at one last example. We'll extend the previous one to have
a return type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32) -&gt; &amp;'a u32
    &lt;:
for&lt;'b, 'c&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32, &amp;'c u32) -&gt; &amp;'b u32
</code></pre>
<p>Despite seeming very similar to the previous example, this case is going to get
an error. That's good: the problem is that we've gone from a fn that promises
to return one of its two arguments, to a fn that is promising to return the
first one. That is unsound. Let's see how it plays out.</p>
<p>First, we replace the bound region in the supertype with a placeholder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32) -&gt; &amp;'a u32
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32) -&gt; &amp;'!1 u32
</code></pre>
<p>Then we instantiate the subtype with existentials (in U2):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'?3 u32, &amp;'?3 u32) -&gt; &amp;'?3 u32
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32) -&gt; &amp;'!1 u32
</code></pre>
<p>And now we create the subtyping relationships:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32 // arg 1
&amp;'!2 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32 // arg 2
&amp;'?3 u32 &lt;: &amp;'!1 u32 // return type
</code></pre>
<p>And finally the outlives relationships. Here, let V1, V2, and V3 be the
variables we assign to <code>!1</code>, <code>!2</code>, and <code>?3</code> respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1: V3
V2: V3
V3: V1
</code></pre>
<p>Those variables will have these initial values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1 in U1 = {placeholder(1)}
V2 in U2 = {placeholder(2)}
V3 in U2 = {}
</code></pre>
<p>Now because of the <code>V3: V1</code> constraint, we have to add <code>placeholder(1)</code> into <code>V3</code> (and
indeed it is visible from <code>V3</code>), so we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V3 in U2 = {placeholder(1)}
</code></pre>
<p>then we have this constraint <code>V2: V3</code>, so we wind up having to enlarge
<code>V2</code> to include <code>placeholder(1)</code> (which it can also see):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V2 in U2 = {placeholder(1), placeholder(2)}
</code></pre>
<p>Now constraint propagation is done, but when we check the outlives
relationships, we find that <code>V2</code> includes this new element <code>placeholder(1)</code>,
so we report an error.</p>
<a class="header" href="#borrow-checker-errors" id="borrow-checker-errors"><h2>Borrow Checker Errors</h2></a>
<p>TODO: we should discuss how to generate errors from the results of these analyses.</p>
<a class="header" href="#constant-evaluation" id="constant-evaluation"><h1>Constant Evaluation</h1></a>
<p>Constant evaluation is the process of computing values at compile time. For a
specific item (constant/static/array length) this happens after the MIR for the
item is borrow-checked and optimized. In many cases trying to const evaluate an
item will trigger the computation of its MIR for the first time.</p>
<p>Prominent examples are</p>
<ul>
<li>The initializer of a <code>static</code></li>
<li>Array length
<ul>
<li>needs to be known to reserve stack or heap space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enum variant discriminants
<ul>
<li>needs to be known to prevent two variants from having the same
discriminant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patterns
<ul>
<li>need to be known to check for overlapping patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally constant evaluation can be used to reduce the workload or binary
size at runtime by precomputing complex operations at compiletime and only
storing the result.</p>
<p>Constant evaluation can be done by calling the <code>const_eval</code> query of <code>TyCtxt</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>const_eval</code> query takes a <a href="./param_env.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a> of environment in
which the constant is evaluated (e.g. the function within which the constant is
used) and a <code>GlobalId</code>. The <code>GlobalId</code> is made up of an
<code>Instance</code> referring to a constant or static or of an
<code>Instance</code> of a function and an index into the function's <code>Promoted</code> table.</p>
<p>Constant evaluation returns a <code>Result</code> with either the error, or the simplest
representation of the constant. &quot;simplest&quot; meaning if it is representable as an
integer or fat pointer, it will directly yield the value (via <code>ConstValue::Scalar</code> or
<code>ConstValue::ScalarPair</code>), instead of referring to the <a href="./miri.html"><code>miri</code></a> virtual
memory allocation (via <code>ConstValue::ByRef</code>). This means that the <code>const_eval</code>
function cannot be used to create miri-pointers to the evaluated constant or
static. If you need that, you need to directly work with the functions in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/const_eval/index.html">src/librustc_mir/const_eval.rs</a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#miri" id="miri"><h1>Miri</h1></a>
<p>Miri (<strong>MIR</strong> <strong>I</strong>nterpreter) is a virtual machine for executing MIR without
compiling to machine code. It is usually invoked via <code>tcx.const_eval</code>.</p>
<p>If you start out with a constant</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
const FOO: usize = 1 &lt;&lt; 12;
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>rustc doesn't actually invoke anything until the constant is either used or
placed into metadata.</p>
<p>Once you have a use-site like</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type Foo = [u8; FOO - 42];
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler needs to figure out the length of the array before being able to
create items that use the type (locals, constants, function arguments, ...).</p>
<p>To obtain the (in this case empty) parameter environment, one can call
<code>let param_env = tcx.param_env(length_def_id);</code>. The <code>GlobalId</code> needed is</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let gid = GlobalId {
    promoted: None,
    instance: Instance::mono(length_def_id),
};
</code></pre>
<p>Invoking <code>tcx.const_eval(param_env.and(gid))</code> will now trigger the creation of
the MIR of the array length expression. The MIR will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">const Foo::{{initializer}}: usize = {
    let mut _0: usize;                   // return pointer
    let mut _1: (usize, bool);

    bb0: {
        _1 = CheckedSub(const Unevaluated(FOO, Slice([])), const 42usize);
        assert(!(_1.1: bool), &quot;attempt to subtract with overflow&quot;) -&gt; bb1;
    }

    bb1: {
        _0 = (_1.0: usize);
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before the evaluation, a virtual memory location (in this case essentially a
<code>vec![u8; 4]</code> or <code>vec![u8; 8]</code>) is created for storing the evaluation result.</p>
<p>At the start of the evaluation, <code>_0</code> and <code>_1</code> are
<code>ConstValue::Scalar(Scalar::Undef)</code>. When the initialization of <code>_1</code> is invoked, the
value of the <code>FOO</code> constant is required, and triggers another call to
<code>tcx.const_eval</code>, which will not be shown here. If the evaluation of FOO is
successful, 42 will be subtracted by its value <code>4096</code> and the result stored in
<code>_1</code> as <code>ConstValue::ScalarPair(Scalar::Bytes(4054), Scalar::Bytes(0))</code>. The first
part of the pair is the computed value, the second part is a bool that's true if
an overflow happened.</p>
<p>The next statement asserts that said boolean is <code>0</code>. In case the assertion
fails, its error message is used for reporting a compile-time error.</p>
<p>Since it does not fail, <code>ConstValue::Scalar(Scalar::Bytes(4054))</code> is stored in the
virtual memory was allocated before the evaluation. <code>_0</code> always refers to that
location directly.</p>
<p>After the evaluation is done, the virtual memory allocation is interned into the
<code>TyCtxt</code>. Future evaluations of the same constants will not actually invoke
miri, but just extract the value from the interned allocation.</p>
<p>The <code>tcx.const_eval</code> function has one additional feature: it will not return a
<code>ByRef(interned_allocation_id)</code>, but a <code>Scalar(computed_value)</code> if possible. This
makes using the result much more convenient, as no further queries need to be
executed in order to get at something as simple as a <code>usize</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#datastructures" id="datastructures"><h2>Datastructures</h2></a>
<p>Miri's core datastructures can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc/mir/interpret">librustc/mir/interpret</a>.
This is mainly the error enum and the <code>ConstValue</code> and <code>Scalar</code> types. A <code>ConstValue</code> can
be either <code>Scalar</code> (a single <code>Scalar</code>), <code>ScalarPair</code> (two <code>Scalar</code>s, usually fat

<p>If you are expecting a numeric result, you can use <code>unwrap_usize</code> (panics on
anything that can't be representad as a <code>u64</code>) or <code>assert_usize</code> which results
in an <code>Option&lt;u128&gt;</code> yielding the <code>Scalar</code> if possible.</p>
<a class="header" href="#allocations" id="allocations"><h2>Allocations</h2></a>
<p>A miri allocation is either a byte sequence of the memory or an <code>Instance</code> in
the case of function pointers. Byte sequences can additionally contain
relocations that mark a group of bytes as a pointer to another allocation. The
actual bytes at the relocation refer to the offset inside the other allocation.</p>
<p>These allocations exist so that references and raw pointers have something to
point to. There is no global linear heap in which things are allocated, but each
allocation (be it for a local variable, a static or a (future) heap allocation)
gets its own little memory with exactly the required size. So if you have a
pointer to an allocation for a local variable <code>a</code>, there is no possible (no
matter how unsafe) operation that you can do that would ever change said pointer
to a pointer to <code>b</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#interpretation" id="interpretation"><h2>Interpretation</h2></a>
<p>Although the main entry point to constant evaluation is the <code>tcx.const_eval</code>
query, there are additional functions in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir/const_eval/index.html">librustc_mir/const_eval.rs</a>
that allow accessing the fields of a <code>ConstValue</code> (<code>ByRef</code> or otherwise). You should
never have to access an <code>Allocation</code> directly except for translating it to the
compilation target (at the moment just LLVM).</p>
<p>Miri starts by creating a virtual stack frame for the current constant that is
being evaluated. There's essentially no difference between a constant and a
function with no arguments, except that constants do not allow local (named)
variables at the time of writing this guide.</p>
<p>A stack frame is defined by the <code>Frame</code> type in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir/interpret/eval_context.rs">librustc_mir/interpret/eval_context.rs</a>
and contains all the local
variables memory (<code>None</code> at the start of evaluation). Each frame refers to the
evaluation of either the root constant or subsequent calls to <code>const fn</code>. The
evaluation of another constant simply calls <code>tcx.const_eval</code>, which produces an
entirely new and independent stack frame.</p>
<p>The frames are just a <code>Vec&lt;Frame&gt;</code>, there's no way to actually refer to a
<code>Frame</code>'s memory even if horrible shenigans are done via unsafe code. The only
memory that can be referred to are <code>Allocation</code>s.</p>
<p>Miri now calls the <code>step</code> method (in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustc_mir/interpret/step.rs">librustc_mir/interpret/step.rs</a>
) until it either returns an error or has no further statements to execute. Each
statement will now initialize or modify the locals or the virtual memory
referred to by a local. This might require evaluating other constants or
statics, which just recursively invokes <code>tcx.const_eval</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#parameter-environment" id="parameter-environment"><h1>Parameter Environment</h1></a>
<p>When working with associated and/or or generic items (types, constants,
functions/methods) it is often relevant to have more information about the
<code>Self</code> or generic parameters. Trait bounds and similar information is encoded in
the <code>ParamEnv</code>. Often this is not enough information to obtain things like the
type's <code>Layout</code>, but you can do all kinds of other checks on it (e.g. whether a
type implements <code>Copy</code>) or you can evaluate an associated constant whose value
does not depend on anything from the parameter environment.</p>
<p>For example if you have a function</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
fn foo&lt;T: Copy&gt;(t: T) {
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>the parameter environment for that function is <code>[T: Copy]</code>. This means any
evaluation within this function will, when accessing the type <code>T</code>, know about
its <code>Copy</code> bound via the parameter environment.</p>
<p>Although you can obtain a valid <code>ParamEnv</code> for any item via
<code>tcx.param_env(def_id)</code>, this <code>ParamEnv</code> can be too generic for your use case.
Using the <code>ParamEnv</code> from the surrounding context can allow you to evaluate more
things.</p>
<p>Another great thing about <code>ParamEnv</code> is that you can use it to bundle the thing
depending on generic parameters (e.g. a <code>Ty</code>) by calling <code>param_env.and(ty)</code>.
This will produce a <code>ParamEnvAnd&lt;Ty&gt;</code>, making clear that you should probably not
be using the inner value without taking care to also use the <code>ParamEnv</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#code-generation" id="code-generation"><h1>Code generation</h1></a>
<p>Code generation or &quot;codegen&quot; is the part of the compiler that actually
generates an executable binary. rustc uses LLVM for code generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are looking for hints on how to debug code generation bugs,
please see <a href="codegen/debugging.html">this section of the debugging chapter</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-llvm" id="what-is-llvm"><h2>What is LLVM?</h2></a>
<p>All of the preceding chapters of this guide have one thing in common: we never
generated any executable machine code at all! With this chapter, all of that
changes.</p>
<p>Like most compilers, rustc is composed of a &quot;frontend&quot; and a &quot;backend&quot;. The
&quot;frontend&quot; is responsible for taking raw source code, checking it for
correctness, and getting it into a format <code>X</code> from which we can generate
executable machine code. The &quot;backend&quot; then takes that format <code>X</code> and produces
(possibly optimized) executable machine code for some platform. All of the
previous chapters deal with rustc's frontend.</p>
<p>rustc's backend is <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a>, &quot;a collection of modular and
reusable compiler and toolchain technologies&quot;. In particular, the LLVM project
contains a pluggable compiler backend (also called &quot;LLVM&quot;), which is used by
many compiler projects, including the <code>clang</code> C compiler and our beloved
<code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>LLVM's &quot;format <code>X</code>&quot; is called LLVM IR. It is basically assembly code with
additional low-level types and annotations added. These annotations are helpful
for doing optimizations on the LLVM IR and outputted machine code. The end
result of all this is (at long last) something executable (e.g. an ELF object
or wasm).</p>
<p>There are a few benefits to using LLVM:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have to write a whole compiler backend. This reduces implementation
and maintenance burden.</li>
<li>We benefit from the large suite of advanced optimizations that the LLVM
project has been collecting.</li>
<li>We automatically can compile Rust to any of the platforms for which LLVM has
support. For example, as soon as LLVM added support for wasm, voila! rustc,
clang, and a bunch of other languages were able to compile to wasm! (Well,
there was some extra stuff to be done, but we were 90% there anyway).</li>
<li>We and other compiler projects benefit from each other. For example, when the
<a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities</a> were discovered,
only LLVM needed to be patched.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="#generating-llvm-ir" id="generating-llvm-ir"><h2>Generating LLVM IR</h2></a>
<p>TODO</p>
<a class="header" href="#updating-llvm" id="updating-llvm"><h1>Updating LLVM</h1></a>
<p>The Rust compiler uses LLVM as its primary codegen backend today, and naturally
we want to at least occasionally update this dependency! Currently we do not
have a strict policy about when to update LLVM or what it can be updated to, but
a few guidelines are applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>We try to always support the latest released version of LLVM</li>
<li>We try to support the &quot;last few&quot; versions of LLVM (how many is changing over
time)</li>
<li>We allow moving to arbitrary commits during development.</li>
<li>Strongly prefer to upstream all patches to LLVM before including them in
rustc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This policy may change over time (or may actually start to exist as a formal
policy!), but for now these are rough guidelines!</p>
<a class="header" href="#why-update-llvm" id="why-update-llvm"><h2>Why update LLVM?</h2></a>
<p>There are two primary reasons nowadays that we want to update LLVM in one way or
another:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, a bug could have been fixed! Often we find bugs in the compiler and fix
them upstream in LLVM. We'll want to pull fixes back to the compiler itself as
they're merged upstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, a new feature may be avaiable in LLVM that we want to use in rustc,
but we don't want to wait for a full LLVM release to test it out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these reasons has a different strategy for updating LLVM, and we'll go
over both in detail here.</p>
<a class="header" href="#bugfix-updates" id="bugfix-updates"><h2>Bugfix Updates</h2></a>
<p>For updates of LLVM that typically just update a bug, we cherry-pick the bugfix
to the branch we're already using. The steps for this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the bugfix is in upstream LLVM.</li>
<li>Identify the branch that rustc is currently using. The <code>src/llvm</code> submodule
is always pinned to a branch of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm">rust-lang/llvm</a> repository.</li>
<li>Fork the rust-lang/llvm repository</li>
<li>Check out the appropriate branch (typically named <code>rust-llvm-release-*</code>)</li>
<li>Cherry-pick the upstream commit onto the branch</li>
<li>Push this branch to your fork</li>
<li>Send a Pull Request to rust-lang/llvm to the same branch as before</li>
<li>Wait for the PR to be merged</li>
<li>Send a PR to rust-lang/rust updating the <code>src/llvm</code> submodule with your bugfix</li>
<li>Wait for PR to be merged</li>
</ol>
<p>The tl;dr; is that we can cherry-pick bugfixes at any time and pull them back
into the rust-lang/llvm branch that we're using, and getting it into the
compiler is just updating the submodule via a PR!</p>
<p>Example PRs look like:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56313">#56313</a></p>
<a class="header" href="#feature-updates" id="feature-updates"><h2>Feature updates</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this is all information as applies to the current day in age. This
process for updating LLVM changes with practically all LLVM updates, so this
may be out of date!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike bugfixes, updating to pick up a new feature of LLVM typically requires a
lot more work. This is where we can't reasonably cherry-pick commits backwards
so we need to do a full update. There's a lot of stuff to do here, so let's go
through each in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create new branches in all repositories for this update. Branches should be
named <code>rust-llvm-release-X-Y-Z-vA</code> where <code>X.Y.Z</code> is the LLVM version and <code>A</code>
is just increasing based on if there's previous branches of this name. All
repositories here should be branched at the same time from the upstream LLVM
projects, we currently use https://github.com/llvm-mirror repositories. The
list of repositories that need a new branch are:</p>
<ul>
<li>rust-lang/llvm</li>
<li>rust-lang/compiler-rt</li>
<li>rust-lang/lld</li>
<li>rust-lang-nursery/lldb</li>
<li>rust-lang-nursery/clang</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply Rust-specific patches to LLVM repositories. All features and bugfixes
are upstream, but there's often some weird build-related patches that don't
make sense to upstream which we have on our repositories. These patches are
typically the latest patches on the branch. All repositories, except <code>clang</code>,
currently have Rust-specific patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update the <code>compiler-rt</code> submodule in the
<code>rust-lang-nursery/compiler-builtins</code> repository. Push this update to a
<code>rust-llvm-release-*</code> branch of the <code>compiler-builtins</code> repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a commit to rust-lang/rust</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update <code>src/llvm</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update <code>src/tools/lld</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update <code>src/tools/lldb</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update <code>src/tools/clang</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update `src/libcompiler_builtins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit <code>src/rustllvm/llvm-rebuild-trigger</code> to update its contents</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Build your commit. Make sure you've committed the previous changes to ensure
submodule updates aren't reverted. Some commands you should execute are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py build src/llvm</code> - test that LLVM still builds</li>
<li><code>./x.py build src/tools/lld</code> - same for LLD</li>
<li><code>./x.py build</code> - build the rest of rustc</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll likely need to update <code>src/rustllvm/*.cpp</code> to compile with updated
LLVM bindings. Note that you should use <code>#ifdef</code> and such to ensure that the
bindings still compile on older LLVM versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test for regressions across other platforms. LLVM often has at least one bug
for non-tier-1 architectures, so it's good to do some more testing before
sending this to bors! If you're low on resources you can send the PR as-is
now to bors, though, and it'll get tested anyway.</p>
<p>Ideally, build LLVM and test it on a few platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>OSX</li>
<li>Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>and afterwards run some docker containers that CI also does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh wasm32-unknown</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh arm-android</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh dist-various-1</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh dist-various-2</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh armhf-gnu</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send a PR! Hopefully it's smooth sailing from here :).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For prior art, previous LLVM updates look like
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55835">#55835</a>

<a class="header" href="#caveats-and-gotchas" id="caveats-and-gotchas"><h3>Caveats and gotchas</h3></a>
<p>Ideally the above instructions are pretty smooth, but here's some caveats to
keep in mind while going through them:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLVM bugs are hard to find, don't hesitate to ask for help! Bisection is
definitely your friend here (yes LLVM takes forever to build, yet bisection is
still your friend)</li>
<li>Updating LLDB has some Rust-specific patches currently that aren't upstream.
If you have difficulty @tromey can likely help out.</li>
<li>If you've got general questions, @alexcrichton can help you out.</li>
<li>Creating branches is a privileged operation on GitHub, so you'll need someone
with write access to create the branches for you most likely.</li>

<a class="header" href="#debugging-llvm" id="debugging-llvm"><h2>Debugging LLVM</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: If you are looking for info about code generation, please see <a href="codegen/../codegen.html">this
chapter</a> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section is about debugging compiler bugs in code generation (e.g. why the
compiler generated some piece of code or crashed in LLVM).  LLVM is a big
project on its own that probably needs to have its own debugging document (not
that I could find one). But here are some tips that are important in a rustc
context:</p>
<p>As a general rule, compilers generate lots of information from analyzing code.
Thus, a useful first step is usually to find a minimal example. One way to do
this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>create a new crate that reproduces the issue (e.g. adding whatever crate is
at fault as a dependency, and using it from there)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>minimize the crate by removing external dependencies; that is, moving
everything relevant to the new crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further minimize the issue by making the code shorter (there are tools that
help with this like <code>creduce</code>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The official compilers (including nightlies) have LLVM assertions disabled,
which means that LLVM assertion failures can show up as compiler crashes (not
ICEs but &quot;real&quot; crashes) and other sorts of weird behavior. If you are
encountering these, it is a good idea to try using a compiler with LLVM
assertions enabled - either an &quot;alt&quot; nightly or a compiler you build yourself
by setting <code>[llvm] assertions=true</code> in your config.toml - and see whether
anything turns up.</p>
<p>The rustc build process builds the LLVM tools into
<code>./build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/llvm/bin</code>. They can be called directly.</p>
<p>The default rustc compilation pipeline has multiple codegen units, which is
hard to replicate manually and means that LLVM is called multiple times in
parallel.  If you can get away with it (i.e. if it doesn't make your bug
disappear), passing <code>-C codegen-units=1</code> to rustc will make debugging easier.</p>
<p>To rustc to generate LLVM IR, you need to pass the <code>--emit=llvm-ir</code> flag. If
you are building via cargo, use the <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> environment variable (e.g.
<code>RUSTFLAGS='--emit=llvm-ir'</code>). This causes rustc to spit out LLVM IR into the
target directory.</p>
<p><code>cargo llvm-ir [options] path</code> spits out the LLVM IR for a particular function
at <code>path</code>. (<code>cargo install cargo-asm</code> installs <code>cargo asm</code> and <code>cargo llvm-ir</code>). <code>--build-type=debug</code> emits code for debug builds. There are also
other useful options. Also, debug info in LLVM IR can clutter the output a lot:
<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C debuginfo=0&quot;</code> is really useful.</p>
<p><code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C save-temps&quot;</code> outputs LLVM bitcode (not the same as IR) at
different stages during compilation, which is sometimes useful. One just needs
to convert the bitcode files to <code>.ll</code> files using <code>llvm-dis</code> which should be in
the target local compilation of rustc.</p>
<p>If you want to play with the optimization pipeline, you can use the <code>opt</code> tool
from <code>./build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/llvm/bin/</code> with the LLVM IR emitted by rustc.  Note
that rustc emits different IR depending on whether <code>-O</code> is enabled, even
without LLVM's optimizations, so if you want to play with the IR rustc emits,
you should:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rustc +local my-file.rs --emit=llvm-ir -O -C no-prepopulate-passes \
    -C codegen-units=1
$ OPT=./build/$TRIPLE/llvm/bin/opt
$ $OPT -S -O2 &lt; my-file.ll &gt; my
</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to get the LLVM IR during the LLVM pipeline, to e.g. see which
IR causes an optimization-time assertion to fail, or to see when LLVM performs
a particular optimization, you can pass the rustc flag <code>-C llvm-args=-print-after-all</code>, and possibly add <code>-C llvm-args='-filter-print-funcs=EXACT_FUNCTION_NAME</code> (e.g.  <code>-C llvm-args='-filter-print-funcs=_ZN11collections3str21_$LT$impl$u20$str$GT$\ 7replace17hbe10ea2e7c809b0bE'</code>).</p>
<p>That produces a lot of output into standard error, so you'll want to pipe that
to some file. Also, if you are using neither <code>-filter-print-funcs</code> nor <code>-C codegen-units=1</code>, then, because the multiple codegen units run in parallel, the
printouts will mix together and you won't be able to read anything.</p>
<p>If you want just the IR for a specific function (say, you want to see why it
causes an assertion or doesn't optimize correctly), you can use <code>llvm-extract</code>,
e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./build/$TRIPLE/llvm/bin/llvm-extract \
    -func='_ZN11collections3str21_$LT$impl$u20$str$GT$7replace17hbe10ea2e7c809b0bE' \
    -S \
    &lt; unextracted.ll \
    &gt; extracted.ll
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#filing-llvm-bug-reports" id="filing-llvm-bug-reports"><h3>Filing LLVM bug reports</h3></a>
<p>When filing an LLVM bug report, you will probably want some sort of minimal
working example that demonstrates the problem. The Godbolt compiler explorer is
really helpful for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once you have some LLVM IR for the problematic code (see above), you can
create a minimal working example with Godbolt. Go to
<a href="https://gcc.godbolt.org">gcc.godbolt.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <code>LLVM-IR</code> as programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>llc</code> to compile the IR to a particular target as is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful flags: <code>-mattr</code> enables target features, <code>-march=</code>
selects the target, <code>-mcpu=</code> selects the CPU, etc.</li>
<li>Commands like <code>llc -march=help</code> output all architectures available, which
is useful because sometimes the Rust arch names and the LLVM names do not
match.</li>
<li>If you have compiled rustc yourself somewhere, in the target directory
you have binaries for <code>llc</code>, <code>opt</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to optimize the LLVM-IR, you can use <code>opt</code> to see how the LLVM
optimizations transform it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have a godbolt link demonstrating the issue, it is pretty easy to
fill in an LLVM bug.</p>

<a class="header" href="#emitting-diagnostics" id="emitting-diagnostics"><h1>Emitting Diagnostics</h1></a>
<p>A lot of effort has been put into making <code>rustc</code> have great error messages.
This chapter is about how to emit compile errors and lints from the compiler.</p>
<a class="header" href="#span" id="span"><h2><code>Span</code></h2></a>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code></a> is the primary data structure in <code>rustc</code> used to represent a
location in the code being compiled. <code>Span</code>s are attached to most constructs in
HIR and MIR, allowing for more informative error reporting.</p>
<p>A <code>Span</code> can be looked up in a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html"><code>SourceMap</code></a> to get a &quot;snippet&quot;
useful for displaying errors with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html#method.span_to_snippet"><code>span_to_snippet</code></a> and other
similar methods on the <code>SourceMap</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#error-messages" id="error-messages"><h2>Error messages</h2></a>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/index.html"><code>rustc_errors</code></a> crate defines most of the utilities used for
reporting errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html"><code>Session</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/struct.ParseSess.html"><code>ParseSess</code></a> have
methods (or fields with methods) that allow reporting errors. These methods
usually have names like <code>span_err</code> or <code>struct_span_err</code> or <code>span_warn</code>, etc...
There are lots of them; they emit different types of &quot;errors&quot;, such as
warnings, errors, fatal errors, suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>In general, there are two class of such methods: ones that emit an error
directly and ones that allow finer control over what to emit. For example,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.span_err"><code>span_err</code></a> emits the given error message at the given <code>Span</code>, but
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.struct_span_err"><code>struct_span_err</code></a> instead returns a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html"><code>DiagnosticBuilder</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> allows you to add related notes and suggestions to an error
before emitting it by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.emit"><code>emit</code></a> method. (Failing to either
emit or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.Diagnostic.html#method.cancel">cancel</a> a <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> will result in an ICE.) See the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html">docs</a> for more info on what you can do.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Get a DiagnosticBuilder. This does _not_ emit an error yet.
let mut err = sess.struct_span_err(sp, &quot;oh no! this is an error!&quot;);

// In some cases, you might need to check if `sp` is generated by a macro to
// avoid printing weird errors about macro-generated code.

if let Ok(snippet) = sess.source_map().span_to_snippet(sp) {
    // Use the snippet to generate a suggested fix
    err.span_suggestion(suggestion_sp, &quot;try using a qux here&quot;, format!(&quot;qux {}&quot;, snip));
} else {
    // If we weren't able to generate a snippet, then emit a &quot;help&quot; message
    // instead of a concrete &quot;suggestion&quot;. In practice this is unlikely to be
    // reached.
    err.span_help(suggestion_sp, &quot;you could use a qux here instead&quot;);
}

// emit the error
err.emit();
</code></pre>
<a class="header" href="#suggestions" id="suggestions"><h2>Suggestions</h2></a>
<p>In addition to telling the user exactly <em>why</em> their code is wrong, it's
oftentimes furthermore possible to tell them how to fix it. To this end,
<code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> offers a structured suggestions API, which formats code
suggestions pleasingly in the terminal, or (when the <code>--error-format json</code> flag
is passed) as JSON for consumption by tools, most notably the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls">Rust Language
Server</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfix"><code>rustfix</code></a>.</p>
<p>Not all suggestions should be applied mechanically. Use the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.span_suggestion"><code>span_suggestion</code></a> method of <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> to

<a class="header" href="#lints" id="lints"><h2>Lints</h2></a>
<p>The compiler linting infrastructure is defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/lint/index.html"><code>rustc::lint</code></a>
module.</p>
<a class="header" href="#declaring-a-lint" id="declaring-a-lint"><h3>Declaring a lint</h3></a>
<p>The built-in compiler lints are defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint</code></a>
crate.</p>
<p>Each lint is defined as a <code>struct</code> that implements the <code>LintPass</code> <code>trait</code>. The
trait implementation allows you to check certain syntactic constructs the
linter walks the source code. You can then choose to emit lints in a very
similar way to compile errors. Finally, you register the lint to actually get
it to be run by the compiler by using the <code>declare_lint!</code> macro.</p>
<p>For example, the following lint checks for uses
of <code>while true { ... }</code> and suggests using <code>loop { ... }</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Declare a lint called `WHILE_TRUE`
declare_lint! {
    WHILE_TRUE,

    // warn-by-default
    Warn,

// LateLintPass has lots of methods. We only override the definition of
// `check_expr` for this lint because that's all we need, but you could
// override other methods for your own lint. See the rustc docs for a full
// list of methods.
impl&lt;'a, 'tcx&gt; LateLintPass&lt;'a, 'tcx&gt; for WhileTrue {
    fn check_expr(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;LateContext, e: &amp;hir::Expr) {

                    if lit.span.ctxt() == SyntaxContext::empty() {
                        let msg = &quot;denote infinite loops with `loop { ... }`&quot;;
                        let condition_span = cx.tcx.sess.source_map().def_span(e.span);
                        let mut err = cx.struct_span_lint(WHILE_TRUE, condition_span, msg);

<a class="header" href="#edition-gated-lints" id="edition-gated-lints"><h3>Edition-gated Lints</h3></a>
<p>Sometimes we want to change the behavior of a lint in a new edition. To do this,
we just add the transition to our invocation of <code>declare_lint!</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">declare_lint! {
    pub ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS,
    Allow,
    &quot;detects anonymous parameters&quot;,
    Edition::Edition2018 =&gt; Warn,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the <code>ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS</code> lint allow-by-default in the 2015 edition
but warn-by-default in the 2018 edition.</p>
<p>Lints that represent an incompatibility (i.e. error) in the upcoming edition
should also be registered as <code>FutureIncompatibilityLint</code>s in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html"><code>register_builtins</code></a> function in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint::lib</code></a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#lint-groups" id="lint-groups"><h3>Lint Groups</h3></a>
<p>Lints can be turned on in groups. These groups are declared in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html"><code>register_builtins</code></a> function in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint::lib</code></a>. The
<code>add_lint_group!</code> macro is used to declare a new group.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">    add_lint_group!(sess,
                    &quot;nonstandard_style&quot;,
                    NON_CAMEL_CASE_TYPES,
                    NON_SNAKE_CASE,
                    NON_UPPER_CASE_GLOBALS);
</code></pre>
<p>This defines the <code>nonstandard_style</code> group which turns on the listed lints. A
user can turn on these lints with a <code>!#[warn(nonstandard_style)]</code> attribute in
the source code, or by passing <code>-W nonstandard-style</code> on the command line.</p>
<a class="header" href="#linting-early-in-the-compiler" id="linting-early-in-the-compiler"><h3>Linting early in the compiler</h3></a>
<p>On occasion, you may need to define a lint that runs before the linting system
has been initialized (e.g. during parsing or macro expansion). This is
problematic because we need to have computed lint levels to know whether we
should emit a warning or an error or nothing at all.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we buffer the lints until the linting system is
processed. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/session/struct.Session.html#method.buffer_lint"><code>Session</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/parse/struct.ParseSess.html#method.buffer_lint"><code>ParseSess</code></a> both have
<code>buffer_lint</code> methods that allow you to buffer a lint for later. The linting
system automatically takes care of handling buffered lints later.</p>
<p>Thus, to define a lint that runs early in the compilation, one defines a lint
like normal but invokes the lint with <code>buffer_lint</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#linting-even-earlier-in-the-compiler" id="linting-even-earlier-in-the-compiler"><h4>Linting even earlier in the compiler</h4></a>
<p>The parser (<code>libsyntax</code>) is interesting in that it cannot have dependencies on
any of the other <code>librustc*</code> crates. In particular, it cannot depend on
<code>librustc::lint</code> or <code>librustc_lint</code>, where all of the compiler linting
infrastructure is defined. That's troublesome!</p>
<p>To solve this, <code>libsyntax</code> defines its own buffered lint type, which
<code>ParseSess::buffer_lint</code> uses. After macro expansion, these buffered lints are
then dumped into the <code>Session::buffered_lints</code> used by the rest of the compiler.</p>
<p>Usage for buffered lints in <code>libsyntax</code> is pretty much the same as the rest of
the compiler with one exception because we cannot import the <code>LintId</code>s for
lints we want to emit. Instead, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/syntax/early_buffered_lints/enum.BufferedEarlyLintId.html"><code>BufferedEarlyLintId</code></a> type is used. If you
are defining a new lint, you will want to add an entry to this enum. Then, add
an appropriate mapping to the body of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/lint/struct.Lint.html#method.from_parser_lint_id"><code>Lint::from_parser_lint_id</code></a>.</p>
<a class="header" href="#json-diagnostic-output" id="json-diagnostic-output"><h2>JSON diagnostic output</h2></a>
<p>The compiler accepts an <code>--error-format json</code> flag to output
diagnostics as JSON objects (for the benefit of tools such as <code>cargo fix</code> or the RLS). It looks like this—</p>

<p>Note that the output is a series of lines, each of which is a JSON
object, but the series of lines taken together is, unfortunately, not
valid JSON, thwarting tools and tricks (such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool">piping to <code>python3 -m json.tool</code></a>)
that require such. (One speculates that this was intentional for LSP
performance purposes, so that each line/object can be sent to RLS as
it is flushed?)</p>
<p>Also note the &quot;rendered&quot; field, which contains the &quot;human&quot; output as a
string; this was introduced so that UI tests could both make use of
the structured JSON and see the &quot;human&quot; output (well, <em>sans</em> colors)
without having to compile everything twice.</p>
<p>The JSON emitter currently lives in libsyntax/json.rs. (But arguably
it should live in librustc_errors along with the &quot;human&quot; emitter? It's
not obvious to the present author why it wasn't moved from libsyntax

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a copy of <code>@nrc</code>'s amazing <a href="https://github.com/nrc/stupid-stats">stupid-stats</a>. You should find
a copy of the code on the GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Due to the compiler's constantly evolving nature, the <code>rustc_driver</code>
mechanisms described in this chapter have changed. In particular, the
<code>CompilerCalls</code> and <code>CompileController</code> types have been replaced by
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/trait.Callbacks.html"><code>Callbacks</code></a>.  Also, there is a new query-based interface in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> crate. See <a href="../rustc-driver.html">The Rustc Driver and Interface</a> for more
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many tools benefit from being a drop-in replacement for a compiler. By this, I
mean that any user of the tool can use <code>mytool</code> in all the ways they would
normally use <code>rustc</code> - whether manually compiling a single file or as part of a
complex make project or Cargo build, etc. That could be a lot of work;
rustc, like most compilers, takes a large number of command line arguments which
can affect compilation in complex and interacting ways. Emulating all of this
behaviour in your tool is annoying at best, especically if you are making many
of the same calls into librustc that the compiler is.</p>
<p>The kind of things I have in mind are tools like rustdoc or a future rustfmt.
These want to operate as closely as possible to real compilation, but have
totally different outputs (documentation and formatted source code,
respectively). Another use case is a customised compiler. Say you want to add a
custom code generation phase after macro expansion, then creating a new tool
should be easier than forking the compiler (and keeping it up to date as the
compiler evolves).</p>
<p>I have gradually been trying to improve the API of librustc to make creating a
drop-in tool easier to produce (many others have also helped improve these
interfaces over the same time frame). It is now pretty simple to make a tool
which is as close to rustc as you want it to be. In this tutorial I'll show
how.</p>
<p>Note/warning, everything I talk about in this tutorial is internal API for
rustc. It is all extremely unstable and likely to change often and in
unpredictable ways. Maintaining a tool which uses these APIs will be non-
trivial, although hopefully easier than maintaining one that does similar things
without using them.</p>
<p>This tutorial starts with a very high level view of the rustc compilation
process and of some of the code that drives compilation. Then I'll describe how
that process can be customised. In the final section of the tutorial, I'll go
through an example - stupid-stats - which shows how to build a drop-in tool.</p>
<a class="header" href="#overview-of-the-compilation-process" id="overview-of-the-compilation-process"><h2>Overview of the compilation process</h2></a>
<p>Compilation using rustc happens in several phases. We start with parsing, this
includes lexing. The output of this phase is an AST (abstract syntax tree).
There is a single AST for each crate (indeed, the entire compilation process
operates over a single crate). Parsing abstracts away details about individual
files which will all have been read in to the AST in this phase. At this stage
the AST includes all macro uses, attributes will still be present, and nothing
will have been eliminated due to <code>cfg</code>s.</p>
<p>The next phase is configuration and macro expansion. This can be thought of as a
function over the AST. The unexpanded AST goes in and an expanded AST comes out.
Macros and syntax extensions are expanded, and <code>cfg</code> attributes will cause some
code to disappear. The resulting AST won't have any macros or macro uses left
in.</p>
<p>The code for these first two phases is in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/libsyntax">libsyntax</a>.</p>
<p>After this phase, the compiler allocates ids to each node in the AST
(technically not every node, but most of them). If we are writing out
dependencies, that happens now.</p>
<p>The next big phase is analysis. This is the most complex phase and
uses the bulk of the code in rustc. This includes name resolution, type
checking, borrow checking, type and lifetime inference, trait selection, method
selection, linting, and so forth. Most error detection is done in this phase
(although parse errors are found during parsing). The 'output' of this phase is
a bunch of side tables containing semantic information about the source program.
The analysis code is in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc">librustc</a>
and a bunch of other crates with the 'librustc_' prefix.</p>
<p>Next is translation, this translates the AST (and all those side tables) into
LLVM IR (intermediate representation). We do this by calling into the LLVM
libraries, rather than actually writing IR directly to a file. The code for
this is in librustc_trans.</p>
<p>The next phase is running the LLVM backend. This runs LLVM's optimisation passes
on the generated IR and then generates machine code. The result is object files.
This phase is all done by LLVM, it is not really part of the rust compiler. The
interface between LLVM and rustc is in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustc_llvm">librustc_llvm</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we link the object files into an executable. Again we outsource this to
other programs and it's not really part of the rust compiler. The interface is
in librustc_back (which also contains some things used primarily during
translation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: <code>librustc_trans</code> and <code>librustc_back</code> no longer exist, and we don't
translate AST or HIR directly to LLVM IR anymore.  Instead, see
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_llvm/index.html"><code>librustc_codegen_llvm</code></a>
and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_utils/index.html"><code>librustc_codegen_utils</code></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these phases are coordinated by the driver. To see the exact sequence, look
at the <code>compile_input</code> function in <code>librustc_driver</code>.
The driver handles all the highest level coordination of compilation -
1. handling command-line arguments
2. maintaining compilation state (primarily in the <code>Session</code>)
3. calling the appropriate code to run each phase of compilation
4. handles high level coordination of pretty printing and testing.
To create a drop-in compiler replacement or a compiler replacement,
we leave most of compilation alone and customise the driver using its APIs.</p>
<a class="header" href="#the-driver-customisation-apis" id="the-driver-customisation-apis"><h2>The driver customisation APIs</h2></a>
<p>There are two primary ways to customise compilation - high level control of the
driver using <code>CompilerCalls</code> and controlling each phase of compilation using a
<code>CompileController</code>. The former lets you customise handling of command line
arguments etc., the latter lets you stop compilation early or execute code
between phases.</p>
<a class="header" href="#compilercalls" id="compilercalls"><h3><code>CompilerCalls</code></h3></a>
<p><code>CompilerCalls</code> is a trait that you implement in your tool. It contains a fairly
ad-hoc set of methods to hook in to the process of processing command line
arguments and driving the compiler. For details, see the comments in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/index.html">librustc_driver/lib.rs</a>.
I'll summarise the methods here.</p>
<p><code>early_callback</code> and <code>late_callback</code> let you call arbitrary code at different
points - early is after command line arguments have been parsed, but before
anything is done with them; late is pretty much the last thing before
compilation starts, i.e., after all processing of command line arguments, etc.
is done. Currently, you get to choose whether compilation stops or continues at
each point, but you don't get to change anything the driver has done. You can
record some info for later, or perform other actions of your own.</p>
<p><code>some_input</code> and <code>no_input</code> give you an opportunity to modify the primary input
to the compiler (usually the input is a file containing the top module for a
crate, but it could also be a string). You could record the input or perform
other actions of your own.</p>
<p>Ignore <code>parse_pretty</code>, it is unfortunate and hopefully will get improved. There
is a default implementation, so you can pretend it doesn't exist.</p>
<p><code>build_controller</code> returns a <code>CompileController</code> object for more fine-grained
control of compilation, it is described next.</p>
<p>We might add more options in the future.</p>
<a class="header" href="#compilercontroller" id="compilercontroller"><h3><code>CompilerController</code></h3></a>
<p><code>CompilerController</code> is a struct consisting of <code>PhaseController</code>s and flags.
Currently, there is only flag, <code>make_glob_map</code> which signals whether to produce
a map of glob imports (used by save-analysis and potentially other tools). There
are probably flags in the session that should be moved here.</p>
<p>There is a <code>PhaseController</code> for each of the phases described in the above
summary of compilation (and we could add more in the future for finer-grained
control). They are all <code>after_</code> a phase because they are checked at the end of a
phase (again, that might change), e.g., <code>CompilerController::after_parse</code>
controls what happens immediately after parsing (and before macro expansion).</p>
<p>Each <code>PhaseController</code> contains a flag called <code>stop</code> which indicates whether
compilation should stop or continue, and a callback to be executed at the point
indicated by the phase. The callback is called whether or not compilation
continues.</p>
<p>Information about the state of compilation is passed to these callbacks in a
<code>CompileState</code> object. This contains all the information the compiler has. Note
that this state information is immutable - your callback can only execute code
using the compiler state, it can't modify the state. (If there is demand, we
could change that). The state available to a callback depends on where during
compilation the callback is called. For example, after parsing there is an AST
but no semantic analysis (because the AST has not been analysed yet). After
translation, there is translation info, but no AST or analysis info (since these
have been consumed/forgotten).</p>
<a class="header" href="#an-example---stupid-stats" id="an-example---stupid-stats"><h2>An example - stupid-stats</h2></a>
<p>Our example tool is very simple, it simply collects some simple and not very
useful statistics about a program; it is called stupid-stats. You can find
the (more heavily commented) complete source for the example on <a href="https://github.com/nick29581/stupid-stats/blob/master/src">Github</a>.
To build, just do <code>cargo build</code>. To run on a file <code>foo.rs</code>, do <code>cargo run foo.rs</code> (assuming you have a Rust program called <code>foo.rs</code>. You can also pass any
command line arguments that you would normally pass to rustc). When you run it
you'll see output similar to</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">In crate: foo,

Found 12 uses of `println!`;
The most common number of arguments is 1 (67% of all functions);
25% of functions have four or more arguments.
</code></pre>
<p>To make things easier, when we talk about functions, we're excluding methods and
closures.</p>
<p>You can also use the executable as a drop-in replacement for rustc, because
after all, that is the whole point of this exercise. So, however you use rustc
in your makefile setup, you can use <code>target/stupid</code> (or whatever executable you
end up with) instead. That might mean setting an environment variable or it
might mean renaming your executable to <code>rustc</code> and setting your PATH. Similarly,
if you're using Cargo, you'll need to rename the executable to rustc and set the
PATH. Alternatively, you should be able to use
<a href="https://github.com/brson/multirust">multirust</a> to get around all the PATH stuff
(although I haven't actually tried that).</p>
<p>(Note that this example prints to stdout. I'm not entirely sure what Cargo does
with stdout from rustc under different circumstances. If you don't see any
output, try inserting a <code>panic!</code> after the <code>println!</code>s to error out, then Cargo
should dump stupid-stats' stdout to Cargo's stdout).</p>
<p>Let's start with the <code>main</code> function for our tool, it is pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let args: Vec&lt;_&gt; = std::env::args().collect();
    rustc_driver::run_compiler(&amp;args, &amp;mut StupidCalls::new());
    std::env::set_exit_status(0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The first line grabs any command line arguments. The second line calls the
compiler driver with those arguments. The final line sets the exit code for the
program.</p>
<p>The only interesting thing is the <code>StupidCalls</code> object we pass to the driver.
This is our implementation of the <code>CompilerCalls</code> trait and is what will make
this tool different from rustc.</p>
<p><code>StupidCalls</code> is a mostly empty struct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct StupidCalls {
    default_calls: RustcDefaultCalls,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This tool is so simple that it doesn't need to store any data here, but usually
you would. We embed a <code>RustcDefaultCalls</code> object to delegate to in our impl when
we want exactly the same behaviour as the Rust compiler. Mostly you don't want
to do that (or at least don't need to) in a tool. However, Cargo calls rustc
with the <code>--print file-names</code>, so we delegate in <code>late_callback</code> and <code>no_input</code>
to keep Cargo happy.</p>
<p>Most of the rest of the impl of <code>CompilerCalls</code> is trivial:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'a&gt; CompilerCalls&lt;'a&gt; for StupidCalls {
    fn early_callback(&amp;mut self,
                        _: &amp;getopts::Matches,

                        _: &amp;diagnostics::registry::Registry,
                        _: ErrorOutputType)

        Compilation::Continue
    }

    fn late_callback(&amp;mut self,

                     odir: &amp;Option&lt;PathBuf&gt;,
                     ofile: &amp;Option&lt;PathBuf&gt;)

        self.default_calls.no_input(m, o, odir, ofile, r);

        // This is not optimal error handling.
        panic!(&quot;No input supplied to stupid-stats&quot;);
    }

    fn build_controller(&amp;mut self, _: &amp;Session) -&gt; driver::CompileController&lt;'a&gt; {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We don't do anything for either of the callbacks, nor do we change the input if
the user supplies it. If they don't, we just <code>panic!</code>, this is the simplest way
to handle the error, but not very user-friendly, a real tool would give a
constructive message or perform a default action.</p>
<p>In <code>build_controller</code> we construct our <code>CompileController</code>. We only want to
parse, and we want to inspect macros before expansion, so we make compilation
stop after the first phase (parsing). The callback after that phase is where the
tool does it's actual work by walking the AST. We do that by creating an AST
visitor and making it walk the AST from the top (the crate root). Once we've
walked the crate, we print the stats we've collected:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn build_controller(&amp;mut self, _: &amp;Session) -&gt; driver::CompileController&lt;'a&gt; {
    // We mostly want to do what rustc does, which is what basic() will return.
    let mut control = driver::CompileController::basic();
    // But we only need the AST, so we can stop compilation after parsing.
    control.after_parse.stop = Compilation::Stop;

    // And when we stop after parsing we'll call this closure.
    // Note that this will give us an AST before macro expansions, which is
    // not usually what you want.
    control.after_parse.callback = box |state| {
        // Which extracts information about the compiled crate...
        let krate = state.krate.unwrap();

        // ...and walks the AST, collecting stats.
        let mut visitor = StupidVisitor::new();
        visit::walk_crate(&amp;mut visitor, krate);

        // And finally prints out the stupid stats that we collected.
        let cratename = match attr::find_crate_name(&amp;krate.attrs[]) {
            Some(name) =&gt; name.to_string(),
            None =&gt; String::from_str(&quot;unknown_crate&quot;),
        };
        println!(&quot;In crate: {},\n&quot;, cratename);
        println!(&quot;Found {} uses of `println!`;&quot;, visitor.println_count);

        let (common, common_percent, four_percent) = visitor.compute_arg_stats();
        println!(&quot;The most common number of arguments is {} ({:.0}% of all functions);&quot;,
                 common, common_percent);
        println!(&quot;{:.0}% of functions have four or more arguments.&quot;, four_percent);
    };

    control
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is all it takes to create your own drop-in compiler replacement or custom
compiler! For the sake of completeness I'll go over the rest of the stupid-stats
tool.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
# #![allow(unused_variables)]
#fn main() {
struct StupidVisitor {
    println_count: usize,
    arg_counts: Vec&lt;usize&gt;,
}
#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The <code>StupidVisitor</code> struct just keeps track of the number of <code>println!</code>s it has
seen and the count for each number of arguments. It implements
<code>syntax::visit::Visitor</code> to walk the AST. Mostly we just use the default
methods, these walk the AST taking no action. We override <code>visit_item</code> and
<code>visit_mac</code> to implement custom behaviour when we walk into items (items include
functions, modules, traits, structs, and so forth, we're only interested in
functions) and macros:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'v&gt; visit::Visitor&lt;'v&gt; for StupidVisitor {
    fn visit_item(&amp;mut self, i: &amp;'v ast::Item) {
        match i.node {
            ast::Item_::ItemFn(ref decl, _, _, _, _) =&gt; {
                // Record the number of args.
                self.increment_args(decl.inputs.len());
            }
            _ =&gt; {}
        }

        // Keep walking.
        visit::walk_item(self, i)
    }

    fn visit_mac(&amp;mut self, mac: &amp;'v ast::Mac) {
        // Find its name and check if it is &quot;println&quot;.
        let ast::Mac_::MacInvocTT(ref path, _, _) = mac.node;
        if path_to_string(path) == &quot;println&quot; {
            self.println_count += 1;
        }

        // Keep walking.
        visit::walk_mac(self, mac)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>increment_args</code> method increments the correct count in
<code>StupidVisitor::arg_counts</code>. After we're done walking, <code>compute_arg_stats</code> does
some pretty basic maths to come up with the stats we want about arguments.</p>
<a class="header" href="#what-next" id="what-next"><h2>What next?</h2></a>
<p>These APIs are pretty new and have a long way to go until they're really good.
If there are improvements you'd like to see or things you'd like to be able to
do, let me know in a comment or <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues">GitHub issue</a>.
In particular, it's not clear to me exactly what extra flexibility is required.
If you have an existing tool that would be suited to this setup, please try it
out and let me know if you have problems.</p>
<p>It'd be great to see Rustdoc converted to using these APIs, if that is possible
(although long term, I'd prefer to see Rustdoc run on the output from save-
analysis, rather than doing its own analysis). Other parts of the compiler
(e.g., pretty printing, testing) could be refactored to use these APIs
internally (I already changed save-analysis to use <code>CompilerController</code>). I've
been experimenting with a prototype rustfmt which also uses these APIs.</p>
<a class="header" href="#appendix-b-background-topics" id="appendix-b-background-topics"><h1>Appendix B: Background topics</h1></a>
<p>This section covers a numbers of common compiler terms that arise in
this guide. We try to give the general definition while providing some
Rust-specific context.</p>
<p><a name="cfg"></a></p>
<a class="header" href="#what-is-a-control-flow-graph" id="what-is-a-control-flow-graph"><h2>What is a control-flow graph?</h2></a>
<p>A control-flow graph is a common term from compilers. If you've ever
used a flow-chart, then the concept of a control-flow graph will be
pretty familiar to you. It's a representation of your program that
exposes the underlying control flow in a very clear way.</p>
<p>A control-flow graph is structured as a set of <strong>basic blocks</strong>
connected by edges. The key idea of a basic block is that it is a set
of statements that execute &quot;together&quot; – that is, whenever you branch
to a basic block, you start at the first statement and then execute
all the remainder. Only at the end of the block is there the
possibility of branching to more than one place (in MIR, we call that
final statement the <strong>terminator</strong>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb0: {
    statement0;
    statement1;
    statement2;
    ...
    terminator;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Many expressions that you are used to in Rust compile down to multiple
basic blocks. For example, consider an if statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">a = 1;
if some_variable {
    b = 1;
} else {
    c = 1;
}
d = 1;
</code></pre>
<p>This would compile into four basic blocks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">BB0: {
    a = 1;
    if some_variable { goto BB1 } else { goto BB2 }
}

BB1: {
    b = 1;
    goto BB3;
}

BB2: {
    c = 1;
    goto BB3;
}

BB3: {
    d = 1;
    ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When using a control-flow graph, a loop simply appears as a cycle in
the graph, and the <code>break</code> keyword translates into a path out of that
cycle.</p>

<p>Let's describe the concepts of free vs bound in terms of program
variables, since that's the thing we're most familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider this expression, which creates a closure: <code>|a, b| a + b</code>. Here, the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in <code>a + b</code> refer to the arguments
that the closure will be given when it is called. We say that the
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> there are <strong>bound</strong> to the closure, and that the closure
signature <code>|a, b|</code> is a <strong>binder</strong> for the names <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
(because any references to <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> within refer to the variables
that it introduces).</li>
<li>Consider this expression: <code>a + b</code>. In this expression, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
refer to local variables that are defined <em>outside</em> of the
expression. We say that those variables <strong>appear free</strong> in the
expression (i.e., they are <strong>free</strong>, not <strong>bound</strong> (tied up)).</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it: a variable &quot;appears free&quot; in some
expression/statement/whatever if it refers to something defined
outside of that expressions/statement/whatever. Equivalently, we can
then refer to the &quot;free variables&quot; of an expression – which is just
the set of variables that &quot;appear free&quot;.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with regions? Well, we can apply the
analogous concept to type and regions. For example, in the type <code>&amp;'a u32</code>, <code>'a</code> appears free.  But in the type <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>, it
does not.</p>
<a class="header" href="#appendix-c-glossary" id="appendix-c-glossary"><h1>Appendix C: Glossary</h1></a>

(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc/ty/enum.RegionKind.html#bound-regions">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>local crate             </td><td>  the crate currently being compiled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LTO                     </td><td>  Link-Time Optimizations. A set of optimizations offered by LLVM that occur just before the final binary is linked. These include optimizations like removing functions that are never used in the final program, for example. <em>ThinLTO</em> is a variant of LTO that aims to be a bit more scalable and efficient, but possibly sacrifices some optimizations. You may also read issues in the Rust repo about &quot;FatLTO&quot;, which is the loving nickname given to non-Thin LTO. LLVM documentation: <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">here</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html">here</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>                  </td><td>  (actually not an acronym :P) an open-source compiler backend. It accepts LLVM IR and outputs native binaries. Various languages (e.g. Rust) can then implement a compiler front-end that output LLVM IR and use LLVM to compile to all the platforms LLVM supports.</td></tr>
<tr><td>memoize                 </td><td>  memoization is the process of storing the results of (pure) computations (such as pure function calls) to avoid having to repeat them in the future. This is typically a trade-off between execution speed and memory usage.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MIR                     </td><td>  the Mid-level IR that is created after type-checking for use by borrowck and codegen (<a href="../mir/index.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>miri                    </td><td>  an interpreter for MIR used for constant evaluation (<a href="../miri.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>normalize               </td><td>  a general term for converting to a more canonical form, but in the case of rustc typically refers to <a href="../traits/associated-types.html#normalize">associated type normalization</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>newtype                 </td><td>  a &quot;newtype&quot; is a wrapper around some other type (e.g., <code>struct Foo(T)</code> is a &quot;newtype&quot; for <code>T</code>). This is commonly used in Rust to give a stronger type for indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NLL                     </td><td> <a href="../borrow_check/region_inference.html">non-lexical lifetimes</a>, an extension to Rust's borrowing system to make it be based on the control-flow graph.</td></tr>
<tr><td>node-id or NodeId       </td><td>  an index identifying a particular node in the AST or HIR; gradually being phased out and replaced with <code>HirId</code>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>obligation              </td><td>  something that must be proven by the trait system (<a href="../traits/resolution.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>projection              </td><td>  a general term for a &quot;relative path&quot;, e.g. <code>x.f</code> is a &quot;field projection&quot;, and <code>T::Item</code> is an <a href="../traits/goals-and-clauses.html#trait-ref">&quot;associated type projection&quot;</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>promoted constants      </td><td>  constants extracted from a function and lifted to static scope; see <a href="../mir/index.html#promoted">this section</a> for more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>provider                </td><td>  the function that executes a query (<a href="../query.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>quantified              </td><td>  in math or logic, existential and universal quantification are used to ask questions like &quot;is there any type T for which is true?&quot; or &quot;is this true for all types T?&quot;; see <a href="./background.html#quantified">the background chapter for more</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>query                   </td><td>  perhaps some sub-computation during compilation (<a href="../query.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>region                  </td><td>  another term for &quot;lifetime&quot; often used in the literature and in the borrow checker.</td></tr>
<tr><td>rib                     </td><td>  a data structure in the name resolver that keeps track of a single scope for names. (<a href="../name-resolution.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>sess                    </td><td>  the compiler session, which stores global data used throughout compilation</td></tr>
<tr><td>side tables             </td><td>  because the AST and HIR are immutable once created, we often carry extra information about them in the form of hashtables, indexed by the id of a particular node.</td></tr>
<tr><td>sigil                   </td><td>  like a keyword but composed entirely of non-alphanumeric tokens. For example, <code>&amp;</code> is a sigil for references.</td></tr>
<tr><td>placeholder           </td><td>  <strong>NOTE: skolemization is deprecated by placeholder</strong> a way of handling subtyping around &quot;for-all&quot; types (e.g., <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>) as well as solving higher-ranked trait bounds (e.g., <code>for&lt;'a&gt; T: Trait&lt;'a&gt;</code>). See <a href="../borrow_check/region_inference.html#placeholders-and-universes">the chapter on placeholder and universes</a> for more details.</td></tr>
<tr><td>soundness               </td><td>  soundness is a technical term in type theory. Roughly, if a type system is sound, then if a program type-checks, it is type-safe; i.e. I can never (in safe rust) force a value into a variable of the wrong type. (see &quot;completeness&quot;).</td></tr>
<tr><td>span                    </td><td>  a location in the user's source code, used for error reporting primarily. These are like a file-name/line-number/column tuple on steroids: they carry a start/end point, and also track macro expansions and compiler desugaring. All while being packed into a few bytes (really, it's an index into a table). See the Span datatype for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>substs                  </td><td>  the substitutions for a given generic type or item (e.g. the <code>i32</code>, <code>u32</code> in <code>HashMap&lt;i32, u32&gt;</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>tcx                     </td><td>  the &quot;typing context&quot;, main data structure of the compiler (<a href="../ty.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>'tcx                    </td><td>  the lifetime of the currently active inference context (<a href="../ty.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>trait reference         </td><td>  the name of a trait along with a suitable set of input type/lifetimes (<a href="../traits/goals-and-clauses.html#trait-ref">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>token                   </td><td>  the smallest unit of parsing. Tokens are produced after lexing (<a href="../the-parser.html">see more</a>).</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#thread-local-storage-models">TLS</a>                   </td><td>  Thread-Local Storage. Variables may be defined so that each thread has its own copy (rather than all threads sharing the variable). This has some interactions with LLVM. Not all platforms support TLS.</td></tr>
<tr><td>trans                   </td><td>  the code to translate MIR into LLVM IR. Renamed to codegen.</td></tr>
<tr><td>trait reference         </td><td>  a trait and values for its type parameters (<a href="../ty.html">see more</a>).</td></tr>
<tr><td>ty                      </td><td>  the internal representation of a type (<a href="../ty.html">see more</a>).</td></tr>
<tr><td>UFCS                    </td><td>  Universal Function Call Syntax. An unambiguous syntax for calling a method (<a href="../type-checking.html">see more</a>).</td></tr>
<tr><td>uninhabited type        </td><td>  a type which has <em>no</em> values. This is not the same as a ZST, which has exactly 1 value. An example of an uninhabited type is <code>enum Foo {}</code>, which has no variants, and so, can never be created. The compiler can treat code that deals with uninhabited types as dead code, since there is no such value to be manipulated. <code>!</code> (the never type) is an uninhabited type. Uninhabited types are also called &quot;empty types&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td>upvar                   </td><td>  a variable captured by a closure from outside the closure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>variance                </td><td>  variance determines how changes to a generic type/lifetime parameter affect subtyping; for example, if <code>T</code> is a subtype of <code>U</code>, then <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is a subtype <code>Vec&lt;U&gt;</code> because <code>Vec</code> is <em>covariant</em> in its generic parameter. See <a href="./background.html#variance">the background chapter</a> for a more general explanation. See the <a href="../variance.html">variance chapter</a> for an explanation of how type checking handles variance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wide pointer            </td><td>  a pointer with additional metadata. See &quot;fat pointer&quot; for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ZST                     </td><td>  Zero-Sized Type. A type whose values have size 0 bytes. Since <code>2^0 = 1</code>, such types can have exactly one value. For example, <code>()</code> (unit) is a ZST. <code>struct Foo;</code> is also a ZST. The compiler can do some nice optimizations around ZSTs.</td></tr>
